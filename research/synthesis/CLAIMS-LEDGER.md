## Claims Table

### A. The Double-Channel Model (Surface/Substrate)

| # | Claim | Source Author(s) | Cross-Validation Status | Confidence | Craft Implication |
|---|-------|-----------------|------------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| 1 | The double-channel model ($SURFACE_STORY / $SUBSTRATE_STORY) is structurally present in all studied authors and constitutes a universal feature of encoded-queer writing under constraint. | Comparative, Rimbaud, Wilde, Burroughs, Forster, Cavafy, Baldwin, Genet, Delany, Bishop | corroborated | 92 | The writer must build two complete narratives: the surface must be satisfying on its own terms, and the substrate must be detectable only by the attuned reader. Neither channel can be an afterthought. |
| 2 | Wilde deliberately wrote for two audiences simultaneously (general public + queer-attuned readers), and this practice is documented across every author in the corpus. | Wilde, Cavafy, Forster, Baldwin, Bishop, Comparative | corroborated | 90 | The audience split is not accidental. The writer must consciously design both the surface and the substrate reading experiences, calibrating each for its intended audience. |
| 3 | The three anchor authors represent three distinct types of encryption strategy: lyric displacement (Rimbaud), style as alibi (Wilde), systems externalization (Burroughs). | Comparative | unique | 85 | These three modes are starting points, not exhaustive categories. A writer can combine strategies but should be aware of which primary mode they are operating in. |
| 4 | Baldwin practices compositional concealment even when biographical concealment is partial or absent --- demonstrating that encoding is a formal strategy, not merely a defensive response. | Baldwin | unique | 85 | Encoding can be a generative compositional principle, not just a reaction to danger. A writer may choose double-channel composition even under reduced external pressure. |
| 5 | Delany represents the schema's limit case: the writer who pushes the double-channel model to the point where the substrate becomes the surface. | Delany, Comparative | corroborated | 75 | The schema has a boundary condition. When the substrate overwhelms the surface, the double-channel collapses into single-channel confrontation --- which is its own valid strategy, but a different one. |

### B. Concealment as Compositional Engine

| # | Claim | Source Author(s) | Cross-Validation Status | Confidence | Craft Implication |
|---|-------|-----------------|------------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| 6 | Rimbaud employed deliberate encoding strategies to conceal queer desire in his poetry, including pronoun drift, image displacement, and gender inversion. | Rimbaud | unique | 85 | Pronoun drift and image displacement are active tools. The word "deliberate" carries uncertainty --- some encoding may be intuitive rather than planned --- but the writer should still practice these techniques consciously. |
| 7 | The clustering of opacity around erotic content in Rimbaud is evidence of strategic rather than purely aesthetic obscurity. | Rimbaud | unique | 70 | Track where your text becomes opaque. If the difficulty clusters around desire, the encoding is working. If it is uniformly obscure, the substrate has no signal. |
| 8 | Forster's suppression of *Maurice* is the career-defining compositional decision, shaping every subsequent publication and the eventual forty-six-year novelistic silence. | Forster | unique | 95 | The decision not to publish can be as generative as the decision to publish. The suppressed text shapes the published work by creating a gravitational absence. |
| 9 | Papanikolaou's thesis --- that Cavafy's closet *produces* rather than merely conceals sexuality --- is the most accurate framework for understanding the relationship between concealment and composition. | Cavafy | unique | 85 | Concealment is not a loss; it is a compositional engine. The constraint generates formal innovations that would not exist without the pressure to encode. |
| 10 | Bishop's encoding strategy did not relax during the 1970s despite changing social conditions, suggesting encoding had become a generative principle rather than purely defensive. | Bishop | unique | 75 | Once internalized, encoding outlasts its external necessity. A writer working in double-channel mode may find it generative even when the original danger diminishes. |
| 11 | Sartre's *Saint Genet* (1952) paralyzed Genet as a novelist --- demonstrating that external decoding of an author's encoding system can destroy the system's generative function. | Genet | unique | 85 | Being decoded by a critic can collapse the productive tension that generates the work. The writer should be aware that critical "outing" of their methods can interfere with those methods. |

### C. Self-Censorship and Publication Strategies

| # | Claim | Source Author(s) | Cross-Validation Status | Confidence | Craft Implication |
|---|-------|-----------------|------------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| 12 | Self-censorship as compositional strategy is documented in all three anchor authors and most of the expanded corpus: Rimbaud's retreat into silence, Wilde's three-version *Dorian Gray*, Burroughs's 33-year suppression of *Queer*, Forster's suppression of *Maurice*, Cavafy's dual-publication system, Bishop's exclusion of direct poems. | Comparative, Rimbaud, Wilde, Burroughs, Forster, Cavafy, Bishop | corroborated | 92 | Self-censorship is not failure; it is part of the process. The writer must decide what to withhold as deliberately as they decide what to publish. The gap between the written and the published is a formal element. |
| 13 | Wilde self-censored *Dorian Gray* between the 1890 and 1891 editions specifically to reduce homoerotic content, and Stoddart censored approximately 500 additional words before Lippincott's publication. | Wilde | unique | 95 | Revision history is a record of encoding decisions. Compare early and late drafts to identify what was removed and why. The removed material is evidence of the substrate. |
| 14 | The 33-year gap between *Queer*'s composition (1952) and publication (1985) was driven by the text's direct emotional/sexual content about male desire. | Burroughs | unique | 85 | The most vulnerable text may be the last to reach the public. The writer should recognize that the work they are most afraid to show may be the work that matters most. |
| 15 | Cavafy's dual-publication strategy constitutes a material instantiation of the audience-split variable: erotic poems were systematically withheld from journals while historical poems were submitted. | Cavafy | unique | 95 | Distribution is an encoding tool. Different audiences can receive different selections from the same body of work. Controlled circulation is a form of composition. |
| 16 | Cavafy's practice of never publishing a book during his lifetime was a strategic choice related to encoding, not merely temperamental aversion. | Cavafy | unique | 80 | Refusing the finality of the book can keep the corpus in a permanently revisable state, preventing the closure that would fix the text's meaning and reduce deniability. |
| 17 | The Gallimard trade editions of Genet's novels are revised by the author with explicit passages excised --- demonstrating self-censorship as risk modulation for wider circulation. | Genet | unique | 85 | Different editions for different audiences is a material encoding strategy. The writer can modulate explicitness by edition, format, or distribution channel. |
| 18 | Bishop's unpublished poem "It is marvellous to wake up together" demonstrates that she could write direct erotic poetry and chose not to publish it. | Bishop | unique | 95 | The existence of unpublished direct work proves that the encoding in the published work is a choice, not a limitation of ability. |
| 19 | *Hogg* (written 1969) was rejected by publishers for over 26 years solely due to sexual content, including rejection by the Olympia Press editor who had published *Lolita*. | Delany | unique | 90 | There are limits to what the publishing system will accept. The writer must understand the threshold and decide whether to modulate the text or wait for the system to change. |
| 20 | The publication history of *Giovanni's Room* --- Knopf's rejection, the agent's advice to burn it, Dial Press's removal of Baldwin's photograph --- constitutes material evidence of surveillance pressure on the compositional process. | Baldwin | unique | 90 | Institutional responses to the text (rejection, censorship, paratextual erasure) are data about the encoding environment. They reveal what the system finds threatening. |
| 21 | The gap between Bishop's published poems and her letters constitutes a material instantiation of the double-channel text, analogous to Cavafy's dual-publication strategy. | Bishop, Cavafy | corroborated | 85 | The correspondence, diary, and other private writings form a shadow corpus that gives the published work its substrate charge. |
| 22 | The three-category taxonomy of Cavafy's poems (Published, Unpublished, Repudiated) is itself an encoding system: the systematic correlation between content explicitness and category is evidence of strategic management. | Cavafy | unique | 75 | Categorization of one's own work can be an encoding tool. The writer's decisions about what to include in the "official" corpus shape what the substrate looks like. |

### D. Pronoun Drift and Referential Blur

| # | Claim | Source Author(s) | Cross-Validation Status | Confidence | Craft Implication |
|---|-------|-----------------|------------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| 23 | "Delires I: Vierge folle" encodes the Verlaine relationship through gender inversion --- near-universal scholarly agreement. | Rimbaud | unique | 90 | Gender inversion (assigning a female speaking position to a male subject) is a documented encoding technique with a long history. It can be deployed at the character level or at the pronoun level. |
| 24 | Pronoun blur ($PRONOUN_BLUR) is more available in languages with gender-neutral second person (French) than in gendered-pronoun languages (English), producing structurally different encoding strategies. | Comparative, Rimbaud | corroborated | 85 | The writer must understand the pronoun affordances of their language. English requires more inventive solutions (character displacement, passive voice, second person) than French or Greek. |
| 25 | Greek grammatical features (pronoun elision, masculine gender of *eros*) are deliberately exploited by Cavafy as encoding tools, not merely incidental features of the language. | Cavafy | unique | 70 | Language-specific features create language-specific encoding opportunities. The writer should exploit the ambiguities native to their language rather than importing techniques from other traditions. |
| 26 | In *Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand*, Delany's pronoun system uses "she/her" as default for all persons and "he/him" only for an individual the speaker finds sexually desirable. | Delany | unique | 95 | Redesigning the pronoun system is the most radical available intervention in referential blur. It forces the reader to experience the estrangement that queer subjects experience within normative language. |
| 27 | "Je est un autre" functions not only as a philosophical statement but as a strategy for dispersing the autobiographical self, preventing confession. | Rimbaud | unique | 75 | The dispersed self is harder to decode. When the "I" of the text is explicitly not the author, biographical mapping is disrupted and deniability increases. |
| 28 | Forster's narrative voice constitutes a "narrator in the closet" --- a strategic deployment of omniscient authority that naturalizes the narrator's selective silences about desire. | Forster | unique | 80 | The omniscient narrator can weaponize its own authority to make silences seem like choices of decorum rather than encoding. Narrative authority itself is a concealment tool. |
| 29 | The seventeen drafts of "One Art" demonstrate a systematic erasure of gendered and named reference to the lost beloved --- material evidence of the encoding process. | Bishop | unique | 90 | Drafts are the archaeological record of encoding. The writer should be aware that the process of removing specificity is itself the encoding act. |

### E. Negative Space as Content

| # | Claim | Source Author(s) | Cross-Validation Status | Confidence | Craft Implication |
|---|-------|-----------------|------------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| 30 | The Marabar Caves episode in *A Passage to India* is the schema's exemplary negative space: an unspeakable event at the structural center of the text whose unnamability resonates with the unnamability of homosexual desire. | Forster | unique | 75 | The central event of a narrative can be the one that is never described. The unspeakable thing at the center generates all the narrative energy around it. |
| 31 | "H" (Illuminations) uses a single initial letter to organize an entire poem around an unnamed/unnameable referent, exemplifying negative-space encoding. | Rimbaud | unique | 85 | A text can orbit a referent without ever naming it. The unnamed center holds the poem together precisely because it cannot be decoded into a single meaning. |
| 32 | Bishop's descriptive precision functions as concealment strategy: the more precisely the surface world is rendered, the less the reader looks for a substrate. | Bishop | unique | 80 | Precision is a form of misdirection. An exhaustively described surface convinces the reader that everything important is visible, concealing what is not. |
| 33 | The "nature poem" genre classification functions as a genre alibi that deflects queer reading of poems like "The Fish," "The Moose," and "At the Fishhouses." | Bishop | unique | 80 | Genre labels are reading instructions. If the reader classifies a text as "nature poem," they stop looking for human desire. Genre itself is an encoding layer. |
| 34 | Cavafy's "semi-hidden" phrasing represents a distinct encoding technique from Rimbaud's sensory surplus and Wilde's camp encryption --- encoding through absence rather than excess. | Cavafy, Comparative | corroborated | 90 | There is a spectrum between saying too much (Rimbaud) and saying too little (Cavafy). Both extremes produce encoding. The writer must find their position on this spectrum. |
| 35 | Rimbaud's prose poems differ from Baudelaire's specifically in their refusal of narrative transition, producing discontinuity that serves both aesthetic and concealment purposes. | Rimbaud | unique | 80 | Discontinuity is not just style; it is a functional tool. By refusing to connect episodes, the writer prevents the reader from constructing a continuous biographical narrative. |
| 36 | Bishop's output of only 101 published poems across thirty years is itself an encoding datum: radical restriction of the published corpus as editorial concealment. | Bishop | unique | 70 | Smallness can be a form of control. The less you publish, the less material exists for biographical decoding. |

### F. Overdetermined Innocent Details and Displacement

| # | Claim | Source Author(s) | Cross-Validation Status | Confidence | Craft Implication |
|---|-------|-----------------|------------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| 37 | The voyant doctrine ("dereglement de tous les sens") functions as both sincere poetic program and permission structure for sexual content. | Rimbaud | unique | 80 | An aesthetic manifesto can double as a permission structure for encoded content. The writer can use their stated poetics to justify the substrate material on surface-aesthetic grounds. |
| 38 | Wilde's Preface to *Dorian Gray* functions as a pre-emptive legal defense, not merely an aesthetic manifesto. | Wilde | unique | 80 | Paratextual framing (prefaces, epigraphs, author's notes) can function as defensive architecture. The writer can pre-empt hostile readings by providing an alternative interpretive framework. |
| 39 | "Earnest" functioned as period slang for homosexual; "Bunbury" carries an obscene homosexual pun. | Wilde | unique | 73 | Vocabulary can operate on two registers simultaneously. A word that is innocent to one audience and loaded for another is the minimal unit of double-channel writing. |
| 40 | Cigarette cases carried queer-coded significance in Wilde's social circle and were used as evidence at trial. | Wilde | unique | 90 | Material objects can be encoding carriers. A prop that appears decorative to one audience can be a signal to another. The risk is that hostile readers may also decode the object. |
| 41 | "Antique" (Illuminations) uses the "double sex" of the faun figure to encode androgynous/queer desire through mythological displacement. | Rimbaud | unique | 80 | Mythology provides ready-made displacement structures. The androgynous figure (faun, hermaphrodite, angel) allows the writer to encode non-normative desire through an aesthetically sanctioned referent. |
| 42 | "Conte" (Illuminations) encodes a same-sex encounter through the Prince-Genie narrative, including "shameful beauty" and mutual annihilation. | Rimbaud | unique | 75 | The fairy-tale or allegorical narrative provides a structure where desire and destruction can coexist without the text naming either as "homosexual." |
| 43 | *Salome* routes queer desire through biblical/mythological displacement. | Wilde | unique | 80 | Biblical and mythological material provides high-prestige displacement structures. The cultural authority of the source material raises the plausible deniability of the encoding. |
| 44 | Cavafy's temporal displacement of desire into historical settings functions as an encoding mechanism, not merely as scholarly interest. | Cavafy | unique | 90 | Setting desire in the past creates automatic distance between the author and the content. The historical frame provides a built-in alibi: "I am writing about Alexandria, not about myself." |
| 45 | Cavafy's engagement with ancient sculpture functions as an ekphrastic substitution mechanism, routing desire through aesthetically sanctioned objects. | Cavafy | unique | 75 | The art object (sculpture, painting) can serve as a proxy for the body. Describing a beautiful statue allows the writer to render the male body without confessional exposure. |
| 46 | Addiction vocabulary in Burroughs systematically displaces desire vocabulary. | Burroughs | unique | 80 | Substitute vocabularies (addiction, illness, hunger) can carry the charge of desire while maintaining surface deniability. The reader must recognize the substitution for the substrate to activate. |
| 47 | The "algebra of need" functions as a dual-channel statement: surface = addiction economics, substrate = desire under prohibition. | Burroughs | unique | 75 | A single conceptual framework can organize both channels simultaneously. The metaphor that explains the surface also, for the attuned reader, explains the substrate. |
| 48 | The decision to write *Giovanni's Room* with an all-white cast is simultaneously an aesthetic choice and an encryption strategy --- race is encoded through chromatic imagery even though the characters are white. | Baldwin | unique | 78 | Absence is a form of encoding. What is deliberately excluded from a text creates a negative-space presence that the attuned reader can detect. |
| 49 | Gospel music functions as an erotic carrier in Baldwin's fiction, blending the devotional and the sexual. | Baldwin | unique | 85 | Institutional language (religious, legal, bureaucratic) can be repurposed as an erotic carrier. The devotional and the sexual share structural features (ecstasy, surrender, transformation) that allow blending. |
| 50 | "Crusoe in England" encodes grief for Lota de Macedo Soares through the figure of Friday, with the male persona functioning as gender displacement. | Bishop | unique | 80 | The persona poem (writing as someone else) provides a gender-displacement mechanism. A female poet adopting a male persona can encode a female beloved as a male companion. |
| 51 | "Insomnia" (1951) encodes a declaration of requited queer love by locating it in an inverted, mirror-world where normal rules of reality are suspended. | Bishop | unique | 85 | The fantastic or inverted setting creates a permission zone. What cannot be said in the real world can be said in a world explicitly marked as reversed or dreamlike. |
| 52 | The flower in Genet's imagery functions as a multivalent symbol encoding desire, mortality, queerness, and the sacred simultaneously. | Genet | unique | 80 | A single recurring image can carry multiple encoded meanings across a body of work, accumulating resonance with each appearance. |

### G. Public Mask vs. Private Voice

| # | Claim | Source Author(s) | Cross-Validation Status | Confidence | Craft Implication |
|---|-------|-----------------|------------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| 53 | Wilde's dialogue essays ("The Decay of Lying," "The Critic as Artist") use the dialogue form to multiply deniability about which position is the author's. | Wilde | unique | 80 | The dialogue form distributes authorial opinions across multiple speakers, preventing the reader from attributing any single position to the author. Multi-voiced forms increase deniability. |
| 54 | Wilde's society comedies use the "fallen woman" and "secret past" tropes as structural parallels for closeted experience. | Wilde | unique | 70 | Plot structures from the dominant culture (the woman with a past, the man with a secret) can be repurposed as structural encodings of queer experience. |
| 55 | Genet's "autobiographical" writings are demonstrably embellished; the "confession" functions as self-mythology rather than documentary truth. | Genet | unique | 85 | Confession is not necessarily truth. The writer who confesses extravagantly creates so much noise that the actual signal becomes harder to locate. Excessive confession is a concealment technique. |
| 56 | Baldwin's confessional essay strategy uses racial confession as camouflage for sexual concealment. | Baldwin | unique | 70 | One form of vulnerability can camouflage another. If the writer confesses powerfully about one axis of identity, the audience may assume they have received the whole truth. |
| 57 | Forster's concept of "prophecy" in *Aspects of the Novel* --- "the attendance of intangible infinity to the everyday" --- can be read as a coded description of the substrate channel. | Forster | unique | 60 | Critical and theoretical writing can be a covert manifesto for one's own practice. The writer can describe their encoding method in abstract terms without acknowledging it as personal. |
| 58 | Character-as-function (rather than person) in Burroughs prevents identification and protects the author from autobiographical attribution. | Burroughs | unique | 80 | Functional characters (defined by role rather than psychology) are harder to map onto real people than psychologically developed characters. The more abstract the characterization, the less biographical the reading. |
| 59 | Baldwin's phrase "sexually dubious" is a precisely calibrated encoding: it acknowledges sexual unorthodoxy without specifying it. | Baldwin | unique | 75 | Vague self-description can be an encoding tool. The writer can acknowledge the existence of a secret without revealing its contents. |
| 60 | Genet's fiction "contains no such thing as 'homosexuals' --- just men loving, lusting after, and adoring other men," avoiding identity categories in favor of action and desire. | Genet | unique | 80 | Refusing identity categories in fiction while depicting desire directly is a form of encoding that works by decoupling acts from identities. |
| 61 | Forster's relationship with Bob Buckingham (a married policeman) is the biographical analogue of the double-channel text: queer life folded into heterosexual family structure. | Forster | unique | 95 | Life itself can be organized as a double-channel text. The writer's biography may model the same structures they use in their fiction. |
| 62 | The pseudonym "William Lee" inaugurates Burroughs's practice of authorial fragmentation. | Burroughs | unique | 70 | Pseudonyms and authorial fragmentation are material encoding tools. A writer who publishes under multiple names distributes their autobiographical exposure across identities. |
| 63 | Delany's theoretical self-commentary (including writing under the pseudonym K. Leslie Steiner) functions as part of the encoding apparatus, not as external criticism. | Delany | unique | 70 | The writer's critical writing about their own work can be part of the encoding, not a decoding. Self-commentary can add another layer of deniability. |

### H. Camp as Encryption

| # | Claim | Source Author(s) | Cross-Validation Status | Confidence | Craft Implication |
|---|-------|-----------------|------------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| 64 | Camp functioned as an encryption system (not merely personal style) for queer writers before the term was theorized. | Wilde, Comparative | corroborated | 78 | Camp is a pre-theoretical encoding tool: artificiality, exaggeration, and surface obsession conceal the deadly serious content beneath. The writer can use camp as a defensive layer without naming it. |
| 65 | Camp is author-specific to the Wildean strategy rather than universal to concealment-as-composition. Rimbaud and Burroughs operate without it. | Comparative | unique | 80 | Camp is one encryption mode, not the only one. A writer whose temperament is lyric (Rimbaud) or systemic (Burroughs) should not force camp into their work. |
| 66 | Genet's "obscenity as counter-censorship" operates liturgically rather than mechanically (contrast with Burroughs), producing deniability through aesthetic transport rather than shock. | Genet | unique | 70 | Liturgical language (hymn-like, ritualistic, incantatory) can encode transgressive content by framing it as sacred. If the prose sounds like prayer, the reader may process the content as devotion rather than pornography. |
| 67 | The sacred-profane oscillation in Genet's prose creates interpretive instability that functions as encryption: the reader cannot stabilize either register. | Genet | unique | 70 | Oscillation between registers (sacred/profane, serious/comic, lyric/clinical) prevents the reader from fixing on a single interpretation, which is itself a form of deniability. |
| 68 | Cavafy's irony in historical poems encodes the specific knowledge of the closeted subject who understands the gap between appearance and reality. | Cavafy | unique | 70 | Irony is a natural encoding tool for the closeted subject. The gap between what is said and what is meant in irony mirrors the gap between the surface and the substrate. |

### I. Surveillance as Third Entity

| # | Claim | Source Author(s) | Cross-Validation Status | Confidence | Craft Implication |
|---|-------|-----------------|------------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| 69 | The Labouchere Amendment (1885) created the specific legal threat under which Wilde's encryption strategies developed. | Wilde | unique | 98 | Legal regimes create the encoding environment. The writer must understand the specific legal and social constraints they operate under, as these shape the specific encoding techniques available. |
| 70 | France decriminalized sodomy in 1791 but continued social and police persecution of homosexual activity throughout the 19th century. | Rimbaud | unique | 95 | Decriminalization does not eliminate encoding pressure. Social persecution without legal prohibition produces a different constraint field from explicit criminalization, requiring different encoding strategies. |
| 71 | French homosexuality law was paradoxical in Genet's period: same-sex acts were not categorically criminal (since 1791), but Vichy-era Article 331 and "outrages aux moeurs" charges created a de facto regime of persecution. | Genet | unique | 90 | Legal ambiguity can be more dangerous than clear prohibition. When the law is inconsistent, the writer faces unpredictable risk, which may produce more elaborate encoding than clear criminalization would. |
| 72 | The Lavender Scare created specific conditions under which Burroughs's surveillance aesthetics were produced --- thousands of gay federal employees dismissed, FBI surveillance of homosexuals as systematic policy. | Burroughs | unique | 90 | State surveillance creates not just danger but aesthetic material. The paranoia and systems-awareness that surveillance produces become compositional resources. |
| 73 | Spatial paranoia in Burroughs maps to the queer experience of navigating public space under surveillance. | Burroughs | unique | 75 | The geography of a fictional world can encode the surveillance geography of the queer experience: zones of legality, shifting permissions, the constant calculation of safety. |
| 74 | $PLAUSIBLE_DENIABILITY operates differently under different legal regimes: decriminalization-without-acceptance (Rimbaud), explicit criminalization (Wilde), state-level security-apparatus surveillance (Burroughs). | Comparative | unique | 90 | The writer must calibrate their encoding to the specific regime they face. Techniques that work under social stigma may be insufficient under legal prosecution, and vice versa. |
| 75 | The Cleveland Street scandal (1889) heightened public awareness of male homosexuality and increased risk for queer writers in Wilde's England. | Wilde | unique | 90 | Public scandals change the encoding environment abruptly. A writer must recalibrate encoding depth after any event that changes the audience's awareness or suspicion. |
| 76 | The FBI's surveillance of Baldwin specifically weaponized his homosexuality --- Hoover's marginal note "Isn't Baldwin a well-known pervert?" | Baldwin | unique | 95 | Surveillance agencies exploit the double concealment. When the state has access to the substrate, it can use the threat of exposure to control the writer. |
| 77 | Verlaine's sentence for shooting Rimbaud was aggravated by evidence of homosexuality. | Rimbaud | unique | 90 | Legal consequences can be inflated by the substrate. A criminal act by a queer person may be punished more harshly when the queerness is revealed, creating additional incentive to encode. |
| 78 | Baldwin was excluded from speaking at the March on Washington (1963) at least partly because of his known homosexuality. | Baldwin | unique | 75 | Surveillance and exclusion come from within movements as well as from external authorities. The writer may face encoding pressure from their own community. |
| 79 | Eldridge Cleaver's attack on Baldwin in *Soul on Ice* represents the weaponization of homophobia within the Black liberation movement against its own queer members. | Baldwin | unique | 90 | Internal community surveillance can be as powerful as state surveillance. The writer must encode against multiple audiences, including their own community. |
| 80 | Dr. Benway in *Naked Lunch* functions as a model of conversion therapy and psychiatric control of homosexuality. | Burroughs | unique | 70 | Fictional characters can embody surveillance systems. The doctor, the bureaucrat, the inspector are figures that can encode the institutional apparatus of persecution. |
| 81 | Genet wanted *The Maids* performed by male actors, a casting directive that foregrounds gender performativity as a formal encoding mechanism at the level of theatrical production. | Genet | unique | 90 | Performance and presentation instructions are encoding tools. The casting, staging, and format of a text can carry substrate information that the text itself does not. |

### J. Affect Cost

| # | Claim | Source Author(s) | Cross-Validation Status | Confidence | Craft Implication |
|---|-------|-----------------|------------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| 82 | The affect cost of concealment manifests differently across the authors --- tonal instability (Rimbaud), emotional displacement upward (Wilde), systematic mechanization (Burroughs), anguished lucidity (Baldwin) --- but all show measurable distortion of the emotional register. | Comparative, Baldwin | corroborated | 82 | The emotional register of the text is deformed by the encoding. The writer should be aware of what their specific distortion pattern is --- the affect cost is not a flaw but a signal that encoding is present. |
| 83 | The affect cost of Baldwin's concealment is formally distinct: anguished lucidity, the experience of seeing exactly what concealment costs while being unable to stop paying. | Baldwin | unique | 80 | A distinct affect cost can be a writer's signature. Baldwin's lucidity-under-pressure is as distinctive as Rimbaud's tonal instability. The writer should find their own version. |
| 84 | Bishop's alcoholism functioned simultaneously as symptom, cover story, and self-medication within the encoding schema. | Bishop | unique | 65 | The biographical costs of encoding (addiction, depression, isolation) are real but should not be romanticized. The schema documents the costs; it does not recommend them. |
| 85 | Rimbaud abandoned poetry after the consequences of the Verlaine affair made the costs of his double-channel writing unsustainable. | Rimbaud | unique | 55 | Encoding has breaking points. When the costs exceed what the writer can sustain, silence may be the result. This is not failure; it is the schema's terminal condition. |
| 86 | The career trajectories of all three anchor authors show the concealment schema producing a crisis --- Rimbaud's silence at 21, Wilde's imprisonment at 40, Burroughs's 33-year suppression --- that validates the schema: the system is real because it breaks. | Comparative | unique | 75 | The crisis is evidence that the encoding is real and has real stakes. If the schema never produced consequences, it would be merely aesthetic rather than structural. |
| 87 | Wilde's post-prison writing (*De Profundis*, *Ballad of Reading Gaol*) represents a fundamental shift from encrypted to direct expression. | Wilde | unique | 85 | Encoding can collapse after a crisis. Once the worst has happened, the writer may shift to direct expression because the encoding has lost its protective function. |
| 88 | Burroughs's misogyny and the killing of Joan Vollmer are interconnected with the concealment apparatus and cannot be separated from the queer-desire analysis. | Burroughs | unique | 60 | The encoding system is not morally neutral. It can produce or exacerbate destructive patterns. The writer must be honest about the costs, including costs imposed on others. |

### K. Genre as Alibi / Variable

| # | Claim | Source Author(s) | Cross-Validation Status | Confidence | Craft Implication |
|---|-------|-----------------|------------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| 89 | Genre choice functions as a variable rather than a constant: all three anchor authors modulate genre selection strategically to manage different risk levels. | Comparative | unique | 80 | The writer should consider genre selection as an encoding decision. Comedy (Wilde), prose poem (Rimbaud), science fiction (Burroughs, Delany) --- each genre has a different deniability profile. |
| 90 | The "voyant doctrine as alibi" (Rimbaud) and the "aesthetic alibi" (Wilde) perform the same structural function through different content: providing a philosophical framework that reframes transgression as experiment. | Comparative | unique | 85 | An aesthetic philosophy can function as an alibi for encoded content. "I was experimenting with form" is a defense that reframes the substrate as surface-level innovation. |
| 91 | Delany uses genre not as alibi (cover for queer content) but as compositional engine (a tool for producing alternative social ontologies). | Delany | unique | 75 | Genre is not merely defensive. Science fiction, fantasy, and speculative fiction allow the writer to construct worlds where different rules apply, making the substrate legible on its own terms. |
| 92 | The genre label ("SF writer") has functioned as a form of closet for Delany, making his queerness visible only within a context the broader literary culture does not take seriously. | Delany | unique | 70 | Genre marginalization can mirror sexual marginalization. The writer positioned in a "lesser" genre may find that their encoding is overlooked not because it is invisible but because the genre itself is not read carefully. |
| 93 | Delany's paraliterary theory argues that the distinction between "literature" and "genre" is a mechanism of social control. | Delany | unique | 85 | The literature/genre hierarchy is not neutral; it affects which texts are decoded and which are left encoded. The writer should understand how genre positioning affects the likelihood of their substrate being read. |
| 94 | Genet's shift from novels to plays after *Saint Genet* can be read as a response to Sartre's decoding: the theatrical form provides greater mediation between author and content. | Genet | unique | 70 | Switching forms (from novel to play, from poem to essay) can be a response to encoding failure. A new form brings a new set of conventions and a new deniability structure. |

### L. Translation as Encoding/Decoding Layer

| # | Claim | Source Author(s) | Cross-Validation Status | Confidence | Craft Implication |
|---|-------|-----------------|------------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| 95 | Early editions and translations of Rimbaud systematically softened or obscured sexual content. | Rimbaud | unique | 85 | Translation is a second encoding layer. The translator's choices about pronouns, euphemisms, and register can re-encode or decode the original. |
| 96 | Translation of Rimbaud into English involves unavoidable interpretive choices about gender and desire, with different translators producing systematically different queer valences. | Rimbaud | unique | 85 | Every translation is an interpretation of the substrate. The writer working in a language other than English should be aware that their encoding will be re-processed by translators. |
| 97 | Translation is not a neutral transmission medium for Cavafy --- forced resolution of Greek gender ambiguity in English materially affects which audience receives which channel. | Cavafy | unique | 90 | Languages with different gender systems create different encoding possibilities. A text encoded through gender ambiguity in Greek will be partially decoded (or re-encoded) in English translation. |
| 98 | The full text of *De Profundis* was suppressed until 1962, with editions prior to Hart-Davis omitting queer content. | Wilde | unique | 98 | Textual transmission is an encoding layer. Editors, executors, and publishers make decisions that re-encode or decode the original. The writer should consider posthumous reception as part of the encoding problem. |
| 99 | E.M. Forster's framing of Cavafy as eccentric ("at a slight angle to the universe") enabled decades of desexualized reception. | Cavafy | unique | 85 | A single influential introduction can set the encoding frame for decades. The first critic to describe a writer establishes the interpretive default that subsequent readers must overcome. |

### M. Reception and Misreading

| # | Claim | Source Author(s) | Cross-Validation Status | Confidence | Craft Implication |
|---|-------|-----------------|------------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| 100 | Lionel Trilling's omission of homosexuality from his 1943 study of Forster is evidence of the concealment's success rather than evidence that the substrate does not exist. | Forster | unique | 90 | Successful encoding is invisible. The fact that a critic does not mention the substrate does not mean it is absent; it may mean the encoding is working perfectly. |
| 101 | The posthumous publication of *Maurice* and *The Life to Come* fundamentally altered the critical reception of Forster, collapsing the deniability that had protected the published novels' substrate. | Forster | unique | 95 | Posthumous publication can collapse the encoding apparatus. The writer should consider whether they want the encoding to survive their death or be decoded. |
| 102 | The Symbolist reception of Rimbaud canonized the effects of concealment while refusing to name what was being concealed. | Rimbaud | unique | 80 | Critical traditions can institutionalize the encoding by praising its effects (obscurity, musicality, difficulty) without identifying its causes (concealment of desire). |
| 103 | Rimbaud's use of synesthesia in "Voyelles" has been read as erotic encoding (body-part mapping), generating national controversy. | Rimbaud | unique | 90 | The controversy itself is evidence. When a text generates persistent disagreement about its substrate, the encoding is functioning: it produces reading without producing consensus. |
| 104 | Mainstream critical traditions (Todorov's "intentional incomprehensibility," Claudel's Catholic mysticism) function as interpretive closets that reproduce the text's concealment at the level of reception. | Rimbaud | unique | 75 | Critical frameworks can be encoding collaborators. A critic who provides an alternative explanation for the text's opacity is extending the concealment, whether intentionally or not. |
| 105 | The prosecution's strategy at Wilde's trial was specifically to collapse the distinction between fiction and autobiography that Wilde's aesthetic system maintained. | Wilde, Comparative | corroborated | 93 | The hostile reader's most powerful weapon is to collapse the surface/substrate distinction and claim the fiction is autobiography. The writer must build the surface strongly enough to resist this collapse. |
| 106 | Sinfield's thesis that the Wilde trials consolidated the modern image of the homosexual man as effeminate. | Wilde | unique | 80 | Public crises of encoding can create new stereotypes. The trial collapsed a single writer's encoding into a cultural template, which then constrained subsequent writers. |
| 107 | Passages from *Dorian Gray* were read aloud at trial and used as evidence of Wilde's character. | Wilde | unique | 98 | Fiction can be used as evidence against its author. The writer must understand that encoding failure is not just reputational but potentially legal. |
| 108 | Burroughs was excluded from the queer literary canon despite writing extensively about homosexuality --- evidence that his concealment techniques "worked." | Burroughs, Comparative | corroborated | 83 | Encoding can work too well. If the writer's concealment prevents even sympathetic readers from recognizing the queer content, the substrate becomes permanently invisible. |
| 109 | The critical reception of Baldwin has been distorted by a race-vs.-sexuality binary that reproduces the double concealment that Baldwin's work diagnoses. | Baldwin | unique | 85 | Critical binaries can enforce encoding. When scholarship splits a writer's work into separate categories (racial / sexual), it reproduces the very division the writer was trying to manage. |
| 110 | Genet's reception has been distorted by at least four distinct misreadings (pornographer, existentialist exhibit, provocateur, "bad homosexual"), each of which obscures the double-channel operation. | Genet | unique | 80 | Multiple misreadings can serve the encoding even when each misreading is reductive. If critics disagree about what the text "really" is, no single decoding becomes dominant, and the encoding survives. |
| 111 | Helen Vendler's objection to the publication of Bishop's uncollected poems inadvertently reveals the extent to which Bishop's reputation was built on the concealment apparatus. | Bishop | unique | 75 | Defending the writer's editorial control can mean defending the encoding. Critics who argue for respecting the author's intentions may be, functionally, defending the closet. |
| 112 | The critical tradition that praised Bishop for her "eye," her "rational considering quality," and her "reticence" functioned as institutional extension of the encoding. | Bishop | unique | 80 | Praise can reinforce encoding. When critics praise exactly the qualities that conceal the substrate, they become unwitting collaborators in the concealment. |
| 113 | The Wilde trials of 1895 directly influenced Cavafy's development of his mature encoding method --- the chronological correlation is strong though causation is not documented. | Cavafy | unique | 75 | Major public crises of encoding affect other writers. A trial, a scandal, a public outing changes the encoding environment for all queer writers, not just the one exposed. |

### N. Biographical Encoding and Class

| # | Claim | Source Author(s) | Cross-Validation Status | Confidence | Craft Implication |
|---|-------|-----------------|------------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| 114 | Class-crossing in Forster's fiction (upper-class protagonist, working-class lover) functions as displacement for desire-crossing, reflecting the author's biographical pattern. | Forster | unique | 90 | Class difference can encode desire difference. When the text presents a cross-class relationship, the social transgression can carry the charge of the sexual transgression. |
| 115 | The Sacred Lake bathing scene in *A Room with a View* is the most overtly homoerotic set piece in Forster's published fiction, and its "pagan" framing functions as a specific alibi. | Forster | unique | 90 | The "pagan" or "classical" frame provides an alibi for the homoerotic gaze. If the scene is framed as innocence or nature, the erotic content can be attributed to the reader's projection rather than the author's intention. |
| 116 | Forster systematically fails all heterosexual relationships in the published novels, constituting a structural critique of compulsory heterosexuality. | Forster | unique | 85 | Patterns of failure across a body of work can encode a systematic critique. If every heterosexual pairing in the fiction fails, the pattern itself is a substrate statement. |
| 117 | "What I Believe" (1938) --- "If I had to choose between betraying my country and betraying my friend" --- encodes the specific experience of a gay man whose most important relationship is criminal. | Forster | unique | 85 | Political philosophy can encode personal experience. The writer can articulate a general principle that, for the attuned reader, reads as a specific confession. |
| 118 | Forster's visit to Edward Carpenter and George Merrill at Millthorpe in 1913 was the direct catalyst for *Maurice* and the moment when concealment-as-composition became conscious strategy. | Forster | unique | 85 | Contact with other queer lives can catalyze the shift from unconscious to conscious encoding. The writer who encounters a model of queer living may recognize their own encoding practice for the first time. |
| 119 | Mohammed el-Adl's death in 1922 is encoded in the affect register of *A Passage to India*. | Forster | unique | 80 | Grief can be encoded in affect register without being named. A loss that cannot be publicly mourned may permeate the emotional texture of a text without appearing in its content. |
| 120 | Wilde stated "Basil Hallward is what I think I am: Lord Henry what the world thinks me: Dorian what I would like to be" --- a documented three-way self-distribution across characters. | Wilde | unique | 95 | The writer can distribute different aspects of their identity across multiple characters. This prevents any single character from being a confessional stand-in. |
| 121 | The Parnassian literary establishment's social conservatism constrained Rimbaud's publishing options and incentivized encoding. | Rimbaud | unique | 85 | Literary institutions create encoding pressure. The taste, ideology, and social norms of the publishing establishment shape what can be said and how it must be encoded. |
| 122 | Burroughs's expatriation to Tangier was partly motivated by escape from US sexual-legal constraints. | Burroughs | unique | 80 | Geographic relocation changes the encoding environment. Moving to a more permissive place can reduce encoding pressure, though the writer may still encode for their home audience. |
| 123 | Delany's marriage to Marilyn Hacker, an interracial open marriage, was itself a double transgression (racial + sexual) that prefigured the compound formal challenges of his fiction. | Delany | unique | 80 | Biographical structures can model textual structures. The writer's life arrangements may anticipate the formal problems their fiction will address. |
| 124 | The Mettray Penal Colony experience was formative for Genet's eroticization of institutional hierarchy and his fusion of punishment with desire. | Genet | unique | 85 | Formative institutional experiences (school, prison, military) can generate the encoding environment that shapes an entire body of work. |
| 125 | The Cocteau-Genet relationship exemplifies queer literary patronage: an established queer artist using social capital to create publication channels for an unestablished one. | Genet | unique | 75 | Queer literary networks create counter-institutions to censorship. Patronage, mentorship, and informal publishing networks are part of the encoding ecosystem. |

### O. Narrative Discontinuity and Form

| # | Claim | Source Author(s) | Cross-Validation Status | Confidence | Craft Implication |
|---|-------|-----------------|------------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| 126 | There is an inverse correlation between narrative continuity and publishability in Burroughs's career: the most coherent work (*Queer*) was suppressed, the most fragmented (Nova Trilogy) was published. | Comparative, Burroughs | corroborated | 80 | Narrative coherence increases biographical vulnerability. The more continuous and legible the story, the more easily it maps onto the author's life. Fragmentation is a defensive strategy. |
| 127 | The $DISCONTINUITY_INDEX functions as one of the most reliable formal signatures of encoded-queer writing under constraint --- but Wilde is the counter-case, maintaining continuity and compensating with social-performative encryption. | Comparative | unique | 75 | Discontinuity is a reliable but not universal signature. Some writers encrypt within continuous narrative (Wilde, Forster), proving that formal encryption does not require formal fragmentation. |
| 128 | The cut-up technique in Burroughs functions as a deniability mechanism, not merely an aesthetic procedure. | Burroughs | unique | 75 | Compositional techniques that introduce randomness or collage provide deniability: the content is produced by process, not by intention, so the author cannot be held responsible for what appears. |
| 129 | Narrative discontinuity in Burroughs serves concealment specifically (not only aesthetic innovation). | Burroughs | unique | 70 | Difficulty and obscurity are not the same as encoding, but they can serve encoding by raising the barrier to interpretation. Difficulty makes decoding labor-intensive, which reduces casual discovery. |
| 130 | The fold-in technique prevents biographical timeline construction, specifically protecting the author from temporal mapping. | Burroughs | unique | 65 | Temporal scrambling prevents the reader from constructing a chronological narrative of the author's life from the fiction. The less the text follows a timeline, the less it can serve as biography. |
| 131 | The tape-recorder experiments extend cut-up deniability to the medium of voice. | Burroughs | unique | 65 | Encoding can extend across media. The same deniability mechanisms that work in text can be adapted to audio, visual, and digital media. |
| 132 | *Dhalgren*'s circular narrative structure (beginning and ending mid-sentence) is a structural refusal of the progressive narrative arc including the "sympathetic deviate" narrative. | Delany | unique | 75 | The circular or non-progressive narrative refuses the story structure (crisis-confession-redemption) that the dominant culture uses to contain queer experience. |
| 133 | Bishop's formal use of the villanelle in "One Art" and the sestina in "Sestina" demonstrates formal constraint as emotional constraint --- the form's repetitive demands mirror the closet's compulsive returns. | Bishop | unique | 85 | Fixed forms (villanelle, sestina, sonnet) can encode the compulsive, repetitive quality of closeted experience. The form's constraints mirror the closet's constraints. |
| 134 | The doubling structure in *Querelle of Brest* (Querelle/Robert, murder/sex as structural equivalents) prevents identification of any single character as the author's self-representation. | Genet | unique | 75 | Character doubling distributes the autobiographical across multiple figures, preventing any single character from being decoded as "the author." |
| 135 | The retrospective dead-queer-narrator structure of *Just Above My Head* formally enacts the epistemological condition of the closet. | Baldwin | unique | 80 | The dead narrator is the terminal case of encoding: the queer subject can only be known retrospectively, partially, through heterosexual mediation. |

### P. Historical and Intersectional Claims

| # | Claim | Source Author(s) | Cross-Validation Status | Confidence | Craft Implication |
|---|-------|-----------------|------------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| 136 | The three anchor authors represent three historically sequential phases: pre-identity-politics (Rimbaud), identity under legal prosecution (Wilde), Cold War surveillance state (Burroughs). | Comparative | unique | 75 | The historical period shapes the encoding technology. The writer must understand their own historical moment's specific surveillance and encoding conditions. |
| 137 | The schema derived from the three core authors is biased toward male, white, Western, literary-fiction writers and requires significant extension to claim universality. | Comparative | unique | 95 | The schema is not universal. It must be tested and extended to women, trans writers, non-Western writers, and genre writers before any claim of universality is justified. |
| 138 | Baldwin is the essential "bridge" case because he combines strategies from all three anchor authors while adding intersectional concealment (race + sexuality) that none possesses. | Baldwin | unique | 85 | Intersecting identity axes create compound encoding problems that single-axis models cannot capture. The writer managing multiple stigmatized identities faces a qualitatively different encoding challenge. |
| 139 | Baldwin's career describes a trajectory of escalating disclosure from maximum encryption (1949--1953) to near-direct speech (1985). | Baldwin | unique | 90 | Disclosure trajectories across a career are a feature of the schema. The writer may gradually increase directness as the cultural and personal encoding pressures change. |
| 140 | Delany faces compound surveillance pressures (race + sexuality + genre positioning) that produce unique formal innovations not found in any single-axis writer. | Delany | unique | 80 | Compound marginalizations produce compound innovations. The writer who operates at the intersection of multiple encoding pressures may develop techniques unavailable to single-axis writers. |
| 141 | Bishop's gender position --- as a woman in a male-dominated canon --- creates a doubled encoding burden (concealing queerness + resisting gendered categorization) that distinguishes her from all three male anchor authors. | Bishop | unique | 80 | Gender creates a specific encoding burden for women writers. The refusal to be categorized as a "woman poet" is itself an encoding decision that interacts with the queer encoding. |
| 142 | Bishop refused the label "woman poet" as a strategic refusal of the biographical frame that would expose the substrate. | Bishop | unique | 75 | Refusing categorization can be a defensive encoding move. The writer who resists being sorted into identity-based categories prevents the critical apparatus from activating biographical decoding. |
| 143 | The New Critical doctrine of impersonality provided Bishop with institutional cover for her encoding strategy. | Bishop | unique | 85 | Critical movements can provide encoding cover. When the dominant critical framework prizes impersonality, the encoded writer's strategies are praised as aesthetic achievement rather than questioned as concealment. |
| 144 | Genet's political activism with the Black Panthers and Palestinian resistance represents a redirection of encoding techniques from sexual to political content. | Genet | unique | 75 | Encoding techniques developed for sexual concealment can be repurposed for political content. The skills are transferable across domains of the unspeakable. |
| 145 | Genet's influence on Huey Newton's public disavowal of homophobia within the Black Panther Party represents queer encoding crossing from literary/aesthetic practice into political transformation. | Genet | unique | 70 | Literary encoding can have material political effects. The skills and relationships developed through encoding practice can influence real-world political outcomes. |
| 146 | Proust's gender transposition (Albertine = Agostinelli) represents the most sustained instance of the encoding mechanism Rimbaud uses in "Delires I," applied at novel scale. | Comparative | unique | 85 | Gender transposition can operate at any scale, from a single pronoun to an entire novel-length relationship. The mechanism is the same; the scope is variable. |

### Q. Audience Split and Community

| # | Claim | Source Author(s) | Cross-Validation Status | Confidence | Craft Implication |
|---|-------|-----------------|------------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| 147 | The audience split operates differently across the three anchor authors: implicitly/knowledge-based (Rimbaud), socially/vocabulary-based (Wilde), systemically/structurally (Burroughs). | Comparative | unique | 80 | The writer must choose an audience-split mechanism. Some splits rely on shared knowledge (Rimbaud), some on social belonging (Wilde), some on structural literacy (Burroughs). |
| 148 | The "routine" (Burroughs) and the "epigram" (Wilde) serve structurally similar functions --- compressed performative units that smuggle confessional content through comedic framing. | Comparative | unique | 70 | Short, performative forms (the joke, the routine, the aphorism) can smuggle confessional content. Comedy provides deniability because the writer can always claim "it was just a joke." |
| 149 | The routine is a confession-in-disguise mechanism, specifically documented in Burroughs's *Queer*. | Burroughs | unique | 85 | Routines, riffs, and set pieces can be encoded confessions. The writer performs the truth as entertainment, hiding the personal content behind the performance. |
| 150 | *The Wild Boys* represents a shift toward utopian queer world-building in Burroughs. | Burroughs | unique | 85 | Utopian world-building is a post-encoding strategy. Once the writer has mastered concealment, they can begin constructing alternatives --- worlds where the encoding is unnecessary. |
| 151 | The Johnson Family concept in Burroughs provides a model of queer community without identity disclosure. | Burroughs | unique | 70 | Community can be organized around shared ethics rather than shared identity, providing a model for queer belonging that does not require the risk of coming out. |
| 152 | Cavafy's "inoculation strategy" --- gradual introduction of erotic content across the career --- represents a deliberate compositional plan. | Cavafy | unique | 65 | The writer can gradually increase directness over time, acclimating their audience to substrate content. Each disclosure prepares the audience for the next. |
| 153 | The bathhouse scene in Delany's *The Motion of Light in Water* functions as both testimony and theoretical argument about the closet's epistemological function --- preventing queer people from knowing the scale of their community. | Delany | unique | 85 | The closet has an epistemological function: it prevents queer people from knowing each other. Writing that reveals the scale and presence of queer life is a counter-encoding act. |
| 154 | Delany's cities (Bellona, Kolhari, Tethys, New York) function as queer spaces: environments that produce conditions for cross-class, cross-race encounter. | Delany | unique | 80 | The fictional city can be a queer space by design. World-building that creates conditions for encounter across social lines is a form of substrate composition. |
| 155 | Delany's concept of "multiplex" thinking (from *Empire Star*) functions as a metafictional model for the ideal reader of double-channel texts. | Delany | unique | 75 | The double-channel text requires a reader who can hold contradictory interpretive frames simultaneously. The writer can train their reader to become this kind of reader. |
| 156 | "Myris: Alexandria, A.D. 340" is Cavafy's most sustained encoding of the queer subject's experience of institutional erasure. | Cavafy | unique | 80 | The funeral poem, the institutional ceremony, the public ritual --- these are sites where the queer subject's private relationship is overwritten by the institution's narrative. |

### R. The Virus, the System, and Externalized Desire

| # | Claim | Source Author(s) | Cross-Validation Status | Confidence | Craft Implication |
|---|-------|-----------------|------------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| 157 | The virus metaphor in Burroughs converts homosexuality from a personal attribute into an impersonal biological process, replicating and inverting the medical-pathological model. | Burroughs | unique | 75 | The writer can adopt and invert hostile metaphors. By inhabiting the language used against queer people (virus, disease, contagion), the writer can subvert it from within. |
| 158 | "Sonnet du trou du cul" is co-authored by Rimbaud and Verlaine and explicitly celebrates anal sex --- an early instance of collaborative queer encoding. | Rimbaud | unique | 95 | Collaborative composition distributes authorial responsibility. Two authors can produce content that neither would sign alone, creating a form of shared deniability. |
| 159 | "Le Coeur vole" likely references sexual assault, using ellipsis to encode the violation. | Rimbaud | unique | 60 | Ellipsis can encode trauma. What is left unsaid can be more powerful than what is stated, provided the reader knows to listen for the silence. |
| 160 | "The Tale of Plagues and Carnivals" in Delany's Neveryon series is generally recognized as the first published American fiction about AIDS. | Delany | unique | 85 | Genre fiction can address real-world crises through allegorical encoding. The distance provided by the genre frame allows the writer to address urgent subjects before mainstream fiction is ready to. |
| 161 | The S/M imagery in the Neveryon series serves as a mechanism for making power relations visible that "normal" social relations conceal. | Delany | unique | 70 | Extreme or stigmatized content can make visible the power dynamics that normative content naturalizes. The writer can use transgressive imagery to reveal what polite fiction hides. |
| 162 | The fusion of criminality and homosexuality in Genet's work prevents selective reading that would isolate "interesting" transgression (crime) from "uncomfortable" transgression (desire). | Genet | unique | 80 | Fusing multiple transgressions prevents the reader from selectively engaging with only the "acceptable" one. The writer can bind the encoded content to content the reader wants to engage with. |
| 163 | The masturbatory frame of *Our Lady of the Flowers* creates a circuit between desire, imagination, and text that makes confession deniable: the content is functional (producing pleasure) rather than confessional (admitting truth). | Genet | unique | 70 | Framing the text as functional (for pleasure, for experiment, for exercise) rather than confessional removes the autobiographical claim. The writer did not mean it; the writer was doing something else. |
| 164 | The first manuscript of *Our Lady of the Flowers* was confiscated and burned by a prison guard; Genet rewrote the entire novel from memory. | Genet | unique | 90 | Destruction of the text is the terminal form of censorship. The writer's response --- rewriting from memory --- demonstrates that the encoding is in the mind, not only on the page. |

### S. Schema Variables and Extensions

| # | Claim | Source Author(s) | Cross-Validation Status | Confidence | Craft Implication |
|---|-------|-----------------|------------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| 165 | The schema's 13 variables are sufficient for the three core authors but may need additional variables ($IDENTITY_ENCODING, $INTERSECTIONAL_MASKING, $COMMUNAL_VS_INDIVIDUAL_CONCEALMENT) for women's, trans, and non-Western writing. | Comparative | unique | 70 | The schema is extensible, not complete. The writer working from a non-male, non-Western, or non-cis position should expect to encounter encoding problems the current schema does not fully address. |
| 166 | Delany's stated intention with *Dhalgren* was "to completely subvert... the entire subtext that informs a discourse of 'social problems/sympathetic/sexual deviate/normal' in the first place." | Delany | unique | 90 | Subverting the discourse itself --- not just encoding within it but destroying the framework that makes encoding necessary --- is a post-encoding strategy. |
| 167 | The explicit sex in Delany's major works functions as a normalization strategy (making queer desire unremarkable through routine depiction) rather than as shock or confession. | Delany | unique | 70 | Normalization through routine depiction is the opposite of encoding: it refuses the distinction between speakable and unspeakable. This is the endgame of the schema: a practice that makes encoding unnecessary. |
| 168 | Delany's late novels (*The Mad Man*, *Through the Valley of the Nest of Spiders*) systematically test the limits of what the literary system will accept from a Black queer writer. | Delany | unique | 75 | Testing limits is a diagnostic practice. By pushing past the acceptable, the writer discovers where the encoding threshold actually lies. |
| 169 | Bishop's letters to Dr. Ruth Foster explicitly connect her sexual history to her creativity, constituting documentary evidence of self-awareness about the encoding relationship. | Bishop | unique | 85 | Private documents that explicitly connect sexuality to creative practice are the most direct evidence that encoding is conscious. |
| 170 | The Lowell-Bishop correspondence constitutes evidence of Bishop's self-conscious theorizing about disclosure ethics, particularly her advice against using personal material. | Bishop | unique | 90 | Writers in conversation with each other about disclosure ethics are theorizing encoding in real time. The correspondence is a primary source for encoding theory. |
| 171 | Bishop's positioning as Cluster A (Rimbaud-adjacent) is justified by shared emphasis on negative space and lyric displacement, but the mechanism is inverted: Rimbaud destabilizes through excess, Bishop stabilizes through restraint. | Bishop | unique | 85 | The same structural principle (negative space) can operate through opposite techniques (excess vs. restraint). The writer should choose the technique that suits their temperament. |
| 172 | Genet occupies the C-to-A bridge position: his prose is lyric (Rimbaud-adjacent) while his subject matter is systemic (Burroughs-adjacent). | Genet | unique | 75 | Writers who bridge cluster positions combine encoding techniques from multiple modes, which can produce particularly rich and resistant double-channel texts. |
| 173 | Genet faced automatic life imprisonment under French recidivist statutes after his tenth theft conviction; a petition by Cocteau, Sartre, Picasso, and others secured a presidential pardon. | Genet | unique | 95 | Patronage networks can provide material protection, not just aesthetic validation. The writer's survival may depend on the social capital of their allies. |
| 174 | "Exchanging Hats" was excluded from Bishop's collected poems because its explicit engagement with gender performance exceeded her encoding threshold. | Bishop | unique | 70 | Every body of work has an encoding threshold --- a maximum level of substrate exposure the writer will tolerate in the published corpus. |
| 175 | "The City" and "Walls" by Cavafy function as closet allegories, not merely as existential meditations. | Cavafy | unique | 80 | Philosophical or existential poems can be closet allegories. The language of entrapment, impossibility, and surveillance maps precisely onto closeted experience, but the universal framing provides deniability. |

### S-bis) Wave 2 Author Claims: Acker and Lorde

| # | Claim | Source Author(s) | Cross-Validation Status | Confidence | Craft Implication |
|---|-------|-----------------|------------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| 176 | Literary piracy functions as an encoding mechanism by making authorial confession structurally impossible. | Acker | unique | 85 | If every sentence might be stolen, no sentence can be used as evidence of personal confession. Appropriation is deniability through undecidable attribution. |
| 177 | Identity fragmentation functions as $PLAUSIBLE_DENIABILITY through ontological instability rather than through concealment. | Acker | unique | 80 | If the confessing subject is dissolved, there is no one to hold accountable. Deniability through dissolution of the self, not through hiding. |
| 178 | Acker extends Burroughs's cut-up through a feminist inflection that transforms mechanical fragmentation into political appropriation. | Acker | unique | 85 | The cut-and-paste method is not random but targeted — pirating canonical male texts exposes the canon's assumptions while providing cover. |
| 179 | The Harold Robbins plagiarism lawsuit represents copyright law operating as a surveillance mechanism on compositional practice. | Acker | unique | 90 | Legal systems surveil not just content but *method*. When the method itself is the encoding, the legal threat is existential. |
| 180 | Anti-pornography feminism created a specifically gendered surveillance pressure that the male anchor authors did not face. | Acker | unique | 80 | Women who write explicit sexual content face surveillance from both patriarchal and feminist directions simultaneously. |
| 181 | Acker's affect cost is the inability to sustain tenderness: the piracy apparatus structurally prevents the text from holding a vulnerable feeling steady. | Acker | unique | 75 | The more sophisticated the encryption, the harder it becomes to express the tenderness it was built to protect. The encryption eats the signal. |
| 182 | "The Gift of Disease" (1997) shows what Acker's work sounds like when the piracy apparatus is stripped away by mortality. | Acker | unique | 70 | Terminal illness removes the need for encryption. What emerges reveals what was always there beneath the apparatus. |
| 183 | Lorde's work operates a double channel even in the absence of concealment. | Lorde | unique | 85 | The double channel can be produced by cultural depth and intersectional overload, not only by hiding. Visibility encoding is distinct from concealment encoding. |
| 184 | The concealment-as-composition schema requires expansion to include a visibility mode. **QUALIFIES the core model's foundational assumption.** | Lorde | contested | 80 | The schema describes two modes: concealment encoding (hiding content beneath surface) and visibility encoding (distributing content across more axes than any reader can process). Both produce double-channel texts. |
| 185 | Intersectional mutual camouflage is a distinct encoding mechanism not captured by the existing 6-mechanism model. **CONTRADICTS the implicit claim that the 6-mechanism model is comprehensive.** | Lorde | contested | 80 | Multiple identities distribute audience attention; the identity the audience is not focused on becomes the substrate. This is formally distinct from all 6 core mechanisms. |
| 186 | Lorde's $AFFECT_COST comes from visibility, not concealment — an inversion that requires the variable's definition to be expanded. **CONTRADICTS the comparative report's definition of $AFFECT_COST as exclusively a concealment cost.** | Lorde | contested | 85 | The affect cost variable must describe a spectrum: concealment costs (instability, displacement, mechanization) at one end, visibility costs (exhaustion, rage, isolation) at the other. |
| 187 | Biomythography is a dual-channel genre in which autobiography functions as surface and mythology functions as substrate. | Lorde | unique | 85 | Inventing a genre is itself a signal — the genre designation tells the attuned reader that the surface is not the whole story. |
| 188 | The erotic in Lorde is an epistemological claim, not merely sexual content — and this redefines the schema's treatment of desire. | Lorde | unique | 75 | Desire as method (how the text thinks) rather than content (what the text hides) produces a substrate detectable only by readers who recognize the erotic as a way of knowing. |
| 189 | "Your silence will not protect you" is a direct repudiation of the concealment-as-composition model's foundational rule. **CONTRADICTS the core model's rule: "Never announce queerness."** | Lorde | contested | 75 | The concealment rule describes one available strategy; the visibility rule ("Announce everything") describes another. The choice depends on the writer's relationship to surveillance pressure, risk budget, and affect cost tolerance. |
| 190 | Lorde faces the most complex surveillance pressure in the extended QV33R corpus — more simultaneous axes than any other author. | Lorde | unique | 70 | The irreconcilability of multiple surveillance systems is what makes concealment impossible for Lorde — no single mask protects against all systems. |
| 191 | The schema, post-Lorde, should present concealment encoding and visibility encoding as two available modes, with the double channel produced differently in each. **QUALIFIES claims across all existing reports.** | Lorde | contested | 75 | Concealment encoding: hide the substrate beneath the surface. Visibility encoding: distribute content across more axes than any reader can hold. Both are valid strategies. |

## Summary

### Key Themes

**1. Concealment as Engine, Not Obstacle (Claims 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12)**
The most consistent finding across the corpus is that concealment is not merely defensive but generative. The pressure to encode produces formal innovations --- pronoun drift, negative space, character distribution, genre modulation --- that would not exist without the constraint. This is documented across all 9 authors and is the single most robust finding of the research corpus.

**2. The Audience Split Is Universal (Claims 1, 2, 15, 147)**
Every studied author writes for at least two audiences simultaneously. The mechanism varies (shared knowledge, social vocabulary, structural literacy), but the split itself is present in all cases. This is the core structural feature of the double-channel text.

**3. Self-Censorship as Composition (Claims 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20)**
The decision about what not to publish is as compositionally significant as the decision about what to publish. This is documented with archival evidence in Rimbaud (silence), Wilde (revision history), Burroughs (33-year suppression), Forster (suppression of *Maurice*), Cavafy (dual publication), Bishop (exclusion of direct poems), and Genet (self-censored editions).

**4. Legal and Institutional Regimes Shape Encoding (Claims 69-81)**
The specific encoding techniques are responses to specific legal and social environments. Different regimes (decriminalization with social persecution, explicit criminalization, state surveillance, internal community policing) produce different encoding strategies. The writer must understand their constraint field.

**5. Translation and Reception as Additional Encoding Layers (Claims 95-113)**
The encoding does not stop at the original text. Translators, editors, critics, and publishers add layers of encoding or decoding. The reception history of each author shows how critical frameworks can institutionalize the concealment.

**6. Intersectionality Compounds the Problem (Claims 137, 138, 140, 141, 165)**
Writers managing multiple stigmatized identities (Baldwin: race + sexuality; Delany: race + sexuality + genre; Bishop: gender + sexuality) face qualitatively different encoding problems that single-axis models do not fully capture.

**7. The Schema Has Limits and Breaking Points (Claims 5, 85, 86, 88, 137)**
The encoding system can be pushed to collapse (Delany), silence (Rimbaud), imprisonment (Wilde), or destruction (Burroughs's misogyny, the Vollmer killing). The schema documents these limits honestly.

### Weakest Claims (Confidence below 50)

No claims in this ledger fall below 50 after deduplication and consolidation. The weakest claims cluster at 55--65:

| # | Claim | Confidence | Issue |
|---|-------|-----------|-------|
| 85 | Rimbaud abandoned poetry because encoding costs became unsustainable | 55 | Multiple competing explanations for Rimbaud's silence; the encoding-cost explanation is one among several |
| 88 | Burroughs's misogyny and the Vollmer killing are interconnected with the concealment apparatus | 60 | Risk of explanatory overreach; the killing is a limit case, not a claim that the thesis explains it |
| 159 | "Le Coeur vole" references sexual assault | 60 | Contested interpretation; the sexual-assault reading is prominent but not universal |
| 57 | Forster's "prophecy" concept is a coded description of the substrate channel | 60 | The most speculative claim in the Forster ledger; rests on resonance rather than evidence |
| 84 | Bishop's alcoholism functioned within the encoding schema | 65 | Speculative causal relationship; perfectionism and biography offer competing explanations |
| 130 | Fold-in technique prevents biographical timeline construction | 65 | Inferring concealment function from textual effect; Burroughs framed it otherwise |
| 131 | Tape-recorder experiments extend cut-up deniability to voice | 65 | Burroughs framed experiments as consciousness-liberation, not concealment |
| 152 | Cavafy's "inoculation strategy" is deliberate | 65 | Inferred from pattern; may reflect growing confidence rather than strategic calculation |

### Contested Claims

| Claim | Position A | Position B |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| **Rimbaud's encoding was "deliberate" (Claim 6)** | Textual patterns and biographical context strongly support intentional encoding strategies. | The word "deliberate" carries uncertainty; some strategies may be unconscious responses to pressure rather than planned concealment. |
| **Burroughs's cut-up is concealment (Claims 128-129)** | The correlation between narrative coherence and suppression supports the concealment reading. | Burroughs articulated cut-up in terms of liberation from control, not personal concealment. The concealment function may be operative without being intended. |
| **Baldwin's all-white cast is encryption (Claim 48)** | Baldwin removed racial content; critics reacted to the absence; color coding encodes race internally. | Baldwin may have had purely aesthetic motivations; the chromatic reading depends on a code that may not be intentionally racial. |
| **Bishop's encoding was strategic vs. temperamental (Claims 10, 32, 36)** | Archival evidence (drafts, letters) shows conscious decisions about what to reveal and conceal. | Bishop may have been genuinely private rather than strategically encoding; perfectionism and reticence may explain the same patterns. |
| **Genet's liturgical style is encoding vs. genuine aesthetic (Claim 66)** | The existence of self-censored revisions proves the liturgical register interacts with encoding decisions. | Baldwin and others suggest the sacred-sexual fusion is theology, not encoding --- Genet may genuinely believe the sacred and the sexual are the same thing. |

### Contradictions

| Contradiction | Reports Involved | Assessment |
|---------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Encoding as universal vs. Delany as limit case** | Comparative (Claim 1) vs. Delany (Claim 5) | The double-channel model is universal, but Delany demonstrates that pushing the substrate to become the surface collapses the double channel into a single channel. This is not a contradiction but a boundary condition: the schema describes the range from maximum encoding to minimum encoding, and Delany sits at the minimum end. |
| **Camp as universal vs. author-specific** | Wilde (Claim 64) vs. Comparative (Claim 65) | Camp is documented as an encryption system in Wilde, but the comparative report finds it author-specific rather than universal. Rimbaud and Burroughs operate without it. Resolution: camp is one encoding mode among several, not a necessary feature of all double-channel writing. |
| **Concealment as constraint vs. concealment as generative** | Multiple reports document the costs of concealment (Claims 82-88) vs. Multiple reports document concealment as generative (Claims 4, 8, 9, 10) | This is the central tension of the schema, not a contradiction. Concealment is simultaneously destructive (producing silence, imprisonment, crisis) and generative (producing formal innovation, negative space, double-channel richness). The writer must hold both truths simultaneously. |
| **Strategic intentionality vs. unconscious adaptation** | Claims attributing "deliberate" or "strategic" encoding to Rimbaud (6), Cavafy (15, 152), Bishop (32) vs. Counter-evidence that some encoding may be habitual or unconscious | The schema does not require that all encoding be consciously strategic. Some techniques may begin as unconscious adaptations and become conscious strategies, or may remain intuitive throughout. The question of intentionality is less important than the question of textual function. |
| **The schema is sufficient (Claim 1) vs. The schema needs extension (Claims 137, 165)** | Comparative report | The schema is sufficient for the 9 authors studied but insufficient for universal claims about queer encoding. This is a methodological limitation, not a logical contradiction: the claim is empirically bounded, not theoretically absolute. |

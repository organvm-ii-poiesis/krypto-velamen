# Dial Calibration Matrix
## Preset Configurations for the QV33R Encoding Schema

## How to Use This Document

These are 6 starting positions for the three author dials ($RIMBAUD_DRIFT, $WILDE_MASK, $BURROUGHS_CONTROL). Each preset produces a distinct emotional texture -- a characteristic way the double-channel text sounds, feels, and hides. Use them as starting points, not prescriptions. Adjust any dial +/-10-15 points to fine-tune for a specific piece. The mechanisms listed under each preset are drawn from the 89-mechanism inventory in the MECHANISM-ATLAS; the dial activation ratings (Primary/Moderate/Rare) determine which mechanisms light up at each setting. A mechanism marked "Primary" for High Rimbaud and "Rare" for High Wilde will dominate at R70/W20 but nearly vanish at R20/W80.

## Preset 1: Confessional Whisper
**Dials**: Rimbaud 70 | Wilde 20 | Burroughs 10

### Primary Mechanisms Activated
1. **Pronoun Drift / Referential Blur** (Rimbaud primary) -- the beloved exists as "you" without gender, number, or name
2. **Negative Space as Content** (Rimbaud primary) -- what the piece does not say is its real subject
3. **Image Displacement** (Rimbaud primary) -- desire transferred onto weather, water, light, terrain
4. **Body as Landscape / Landscape as Body** (Rimbaud primary) -- the body is described in geographical terms, geography in anatomical terms
5. **Synesthetic Overload as Screen** (Rimbaud primary) -- too much color, texture, heat; desire present as sensory environment
6. **Apostrophe and Address Instability** (Rimbaud primary) -- the addressee shifts mid-sentence from reader to absent beloved to self
7. **Temporal Dislocation** (Rimbaud primary) -- past, present, and hypothetical mixed so no timeline can be reconstructed
8. **Sacred-Profane Oscillation** (Rimbaud primary) -- tenderness and violence in the same breath
9. **Confession Through Fictional Displacement** (Rimbaud primary) -- emotional truth given to a figure who is not quite the author
10. **Childhood Memory as Displacement** (Rimbaud moderate) -- the child's estrangement as map of adult exclusion
11. **Formal Constraint as Emotional Constraint** (Rimbaud moderate) -- tight form mirrors the closet's demands

### Texture Description
Sensory, intimate, fragmented. Language that feels like remembering a body -- the way skin smelled, how light hit a collarbone. The surface reads as lyric personal essay or prose poem: a meditation on weather, a city at night, the specific quality of a room at 3 a.m. The substrate leaks through sensory surplus -- descriptions that carry more charge than their object warrants, a river described with the tenderness reserved for a lover, a sleeping figure rendered in too much detail. Low wit, low systems. The concealment cost is tonal instability: tenderness keeps getting interrupted by something sharper. The piece cannot hold a single feeling steady because the feeling, if sustained, would name itself.

### Example Passages
- Rimbaud, "Aube": *"J'ai embrasse l'aube d'ete"* -- "I embraced the summer dawn." A narrative of desire and loss transposed entirely onto weather. The dawn is pursued, touched, embraced, and then collapses.
- Rimbaud, "Le Dormeur du val": A dead soldier rendered with intimate tenderness -- *"Les pieds dans les glaieuls, il dort"* -- the body cradled by the landscape, the gaze that inventories this male body (mouth open, neck exposed, chest with two red holes) unmistakably intimate.
- Bishop, "Crusoe in England": *"Friday was nice. / Friday was nice, and we were friends."* The word "nice" is the most inadequate word in the language for the relationship. The beloved is named as beloved only in the sentence that announces death: *"And Friday, my dear Friday, died of measles / seventeen years ago come March."*

### Recommended Mask Types
- **Voyant Alibi**: all sensory excess justified as philosophical or artistic experiment
- **Genre Displacement**: landscape poem, nature writing, prose-poem meditation
- **Confessional Redirect**: the piece appears to confess loneliness or grief while the real confession hides inside the sensory register

### Recommended Signal Types
- **Sensory Surplus**: descriptions carrying too much charge for their surface object
- **Pronoun Drift**: the beloved as ungendered "you" throughout
- **Negative Space**: the conspicuous absence of the person causing all this feeling

### What to Avoid
High camp does not work at R70/W20/B10. Wit and ornament will puncture the intimate register. Avoid epigrammatic reversal, bureaucratic parody, or any mechanism that requires the reader to laugh. Also avoid systems metaphors -- desire-as-addiction or desire-as-contagion will mechanize the tenderness this preset depends on.

### Sample Encoding Schema Walkthrough
- **$SURFACE_STORY**: A post about the smell of someone's apartment after they've left for work -- coffee, laundry soap, the specific warmth of sheets. A meditation on the sensory residue of another person's morning.
- **$SUBSTRATE_STORY**: The speaker is in a man's apartment. They are not supposed to be there this long. The tenderness of the inventory -- cataloguing smells, textures, the dent in the pillow -- is the confession the piece will not make directly.
- **$MASK_TYPE**: Confessional Redirect (appears to be about loneliness and sensory memory)
- **$SIGNAL_TYPE**: Sensory Surplus (the descriptions carry more heat than morning-after-coffee warrants)
- **$SURVEILLANCE_PRESSURE**: Family follows the speaker on social media; the person whose apartment this is has not told anyone either
- **$PLAUSIBLE_DENIABILITY**: 3 -- ambiguous enough that two readers could disagree, but the initiated reader feels the charge
- **$AFFECT_COST**: Tonal instability -- the piece keeps almost saying "I love waking up here" and swerving into the smell of dish soap instead

---

## Preset 2: Defensive Wit
**Dials**: Rimbaud 10 | Wilde 80 | Burroughs 30

### Primary Mechanisms Activated
1. **Camp as Encryption** (Wilde primary) -- exaggeration and theatricality as cipher legible only to the attuned
2. **Epigrammatic Reversal** (Wilde primary) -- compressed inversions of received morality, delivered as jokes
3. **Overdetermined Innocent Details** (Wilde primary) -- surface details that carry coded queer significance
4. **Public Mask vs Private Voice** (Wilde primary) -- the labor of maintaining the social self as hidden subject
5. **Character Doubling and Mirroring** (Wilde primary) -- distributing the self across multiple figures
6. **Dialogue as Mask** (Wilde primary) -- dangerous truths given to characters who can be disowned
7. **Aestheticization as Alibi** (Wilde primary) -- beauty of prose displaces attention from content to craft
8. **Dandy as Performed Illegibility** (Wilde primary) -- the performed self renders the real self unreadable
9. **Coded Sociability and Club-World Signals** (Wilde primary) -- in-group references invisible to outsiders
10. **Irony as Distancing Device** (Wilde primary) -- sincerity made structurally undecidable

### Texture Description
Sharp, social, performative. The surface reads as cultural commentary, satirical observation, or an essay about taste. Every sentence is polished to a gleam. The wit is genuine -- the piece is actually funny -- but the precision of the jokes reveals what is being protected. What the speaker mocks tells you what the speaker fears. Moderate paranoia hums underneath the social performance: the Burroughs at 30 adds a faint awareness that someone is always evaluating, always taking notes. The concealment cost is emotional displacement upward: everything sounds funnier than it feels. The reader laughs with the speaker and does not notice the speaker is not laughing.

### Example Passages
- Wilde, *Lady Windermere's Fan*: *"I can resist everything except temptation."* Surface: charming self-deprecation. Substrate: the impossibility -- and the undesirability -- of resisting desire.
- Wilde, *A Woman of No Importance*: *"The English country gentleman galloping after a fox -- the unspeakable in full pursuit of the uneatable."* The word "unspeakable" resonates with "the love that dare not speak its name."
- Wilde, *The Picture of Dorian Gray*: Basil Hallward's confession -- *"I knew that I had come face to face with some one whose mere personality was so fascinating that, if I allowed it to do so, it would absorb my whole nature, my whole soul, my very art itself."* Surface: an artist's aesthetic devotion. Substrate: a man describing falling in love with another man.

### Recommended Mask Types
- **Aesthetic Alibi**: art-for-art's-sake framing makes content "about craft, not confession"
- **Camp**: if everything is performed, nothing is sincere
- **Genre Displacement**: social comedy, cultural commentary, satirical essay

### Recommended Signal Types
- **Recognition Trigger**: shared vocabulary, coded reference, in-group knowledge
- **Overdetermined Detail**: an innocent object given too much weight
- **Negative Space**: what the jokes avoid saying directly

### What to Avoid
Raw sensory immersion will break the social register. Avoid synesthetic overload, body-as-landscape, or sustained lyric intensity -- these mechanisms require a vulnerability the Defensive Wit preset cannot afford. Also avoid systems-level paranoia or bureaucratic parody at this Burroughs level; the surveillance awareness should stay atmospheric, not structural.

### Sample Encoding Schema Walkthrough
- **$SURFACE_STORY**: A post about the unwritten rules of brunch -- who sits where, who orders what, the semiotics of the group selfie. Cultural commentary on performative socializing.
- **$SUBSTRATE_STORY**: The speaker is performing straightness at a table full of friends who do not know. The inventory of social rules is really an inventory of the rules the speaker follows to remain invisible. The joke about "performing for the camera" is literal.
- **$MASK_TYPE**: Camp (the satirical tone makes every observation deniable as humor)
- **$SIGNAL_TYPE**: Recognition Trigger (specific details -- who holds whose phone, who gets cropped out -- that land differently for the attuned reader)
- **$SURVEILLANCE_PRESSURE**: The group chat; the friend who screenshots everything; the algorithm that decides what gets shown to whom
- **$PLAUSIBLE_DENIABILITY**: 4 -- reads cleanly as social satire; the substrate requires context to detect
- **$AFFECT_COST**: Emotional displacement upward -- the piece is funnier than the situation deserves, and the funniest line is the one that hurts most

## Preset 3: Systems Dread
**Dials**: Rimbaud 20 | Wilde 15 | Burroughs 85

### Primary Mechanisms Activated
1. **Surveillance as Third Entity** (Burroughs primary) -- the watcher is a character in the piece, shaping every utterance
2. **Spatial Paranoia** (Burroughs primary) -- the geography of the piece maps permission and prohibition
3. **Bureaucratic Parody** (Burroughs primary) -- institutional language as simultaneously comic and terrifying
4. **Character as Function, Not Person** (Burroughs primary) -- people reduced to systemic roles
5. **Manual Tone** (Burroughs primary) -- clinical, procedural voice draining affect from content
6. **Pursuit / Agent Structures** (Burroughs primary) -- desire as intelligence gathering, seduction as recruitment
7. **Addiction as Displacement for Desire** (Burroughs primary) -- need vocabulary substituted for desire vocabulary
8. **Cut-Up as Deniability Machine** (Burroughs primary) -- fragmentation prevents attribution of intent
9. **Montage Voice-Masking** (Burroughs primary) -- multiple voices, no stable author
10. **Cage/Room/Prison Metaphor System** (Burroughs primary) -- enclosed space as the closet materialized
11. **Infection / Contagion Metaphors** (Burroughs primary) -- desire as virus, removing moral agency

### Texture Description
Clinical, procedural, uneasy. The surface reads as institutional critique, data-driven observation, or a flat report on how a system works. Every human feeling is translated into the vocabulary of process: longing becomes "need," intimacy becomes "access," love becomes "dependency." The text watches itself being watched. Low lyric, low wit -- there are no beautiful descriptions and no jokes, only the hum of systems processing bodies. The concealment cost is systematic mechanization: tenderness is converted into engineering, and the conversion is the wound. The reader feels anxious without knowing why, because the surveillance pressure that shapes the text is also shaping their reading experience.

### Example Passages
- Burroughs, *Naked Lunch*: Dr. Benway -- *"I deplore brutality. It's not efficient. On the other hand, prolonged mistreatment, testing and ceaseless harassment..."* The clinical detachment parodies the actual language of mid-century psychiatric treatment of homosexuality.
- Burroughs, *Junkie*: *"Junk is not, like alcohol or weed, a means to increased enjoyment of life. Junk is not a kick. It is a way of life."* The flatness of the prose -- its refusal to dramatize -- hides emotional devastation behind clinical observation.
- Burroughs, *The Soft Machine*: Passages where cut-up splices desire with bureaucratic language -- *"naked boy on the bed --- Board of Health regulations require ---"* A collision between desire and institutional control that neither half could state alone.

### Recommended Mask Types
- **Systems Metaphor**: desire translated into impersonal systems vocabulary
- **Genre Displacement**: institutional critique, procedural writing, data analysis
- **Precision as Concealment**: the clinical voice creates an appearance of objectivity

### Recommended Signal Types
- **Structural Paranoia**: the feeling of being watched, catalogued, processed
- **Negative Space**: what the system's paperwork does not record
- **Overdetermined Detail**: a data point given too much weight in an otherwise flat report

### What to Avoid
Lyric beauty will break the clinical register. Avoid sensory surplus, synesthetic overload, and image displacement -- the Rimbaud at 20 permits almost no sensory warmth. Camp and epigrammatic wit are also wrong here; the humor at B85 is bureaucratic absurdity, not social comedy. The piece should never be funny on purpose -- only accidentally, in the way that institutional language is sometimes accidentally hilarious.

### Sample Encoding Schema Walkthrough
- **$SURFACE_STORY**: A post about dating app algorithms -- how the system decides what you see, how profiles are ranked, the metrics that determine visibility. Written in a flat, informational register.
- **$SUBSTRATE_STORY**: The speaker is describing a system that decides who is allowed to desire whom. The algorithm is the surveillance apparatus. The metrics (height, age, distance) are the sorting mechanisms that reproduce the closet digitally. The speaker's own profile is optimized for a version of themselves that does not exist.
- **$MASK_TYPE**: Systems Metaphor (the piece is "about" technology, not about desire)
- **$SIGNAL_TYPE**: Structural Paranoia (the system is watching; the system decides; the speaker has no control)
- **$SURVEILLANCE_PRESSURE**: The platform itself; the data it collects; the friend who might see the profile; the employer who might find the account
- **$PLAUSIBLE_DENIABILITY**: 4 -- reads cleanly as tech critique; the personal stakes are buried in the systems language
- **$AFFECT_COST**: Systematic mechanization -- longing is described as "engagement metrics" and the reader feels the violence of that translation

## Preset 4: Bright Surface, Dark Water
**Dials**: Rimbaud 40 | Wilde 60 | Burroughs 20

### Primary Mechanisms Activated
1. **Overdetermined Innocent Details** (Wilde primary) -- surface details carrying coded significance beyond their occasion
2. **Public Mask vs Private Voice** (Wilde primary) -- the gap between the performed self and the felt self
3. **Aestheticization as Alibi** (Wilde primary) -- the piece is so well-crafted the reader discusses form, not content
4. **Character Doubling and Mirroring** (Wilde primary) -- aspects of self distributed across figures
5. **Homosocial Intensity Beyond Warrant** (Wilde primary) -- emotional charge exceeding what the surface relationship justifies
6. **Domestic Detail as Desire Code** (Rimbaud/Wilde moderate) -- household objects carrying intimate weight
7. **Negative Space as Content** (Rimbaud moderate/Wilde moderate) -- what the polished surface strategically omits
8. **Closeted Narrator** (Wilde moderate) -- a voice performing normalcy while concealing the organizing secret
9. **Emotional Disproportionality** (Wilde moderate) -- reactions that exceed their surface occasion
10. **Threshold Arrest** (Wilde moderate) -- the narrative approaches disclosure and then halts

### Texture Description
Polished, warm, sociable -- but something is wrong underneath. The surface reads as a well-crafted personal anecdote, a lifestyle piece, or a warm observation about friendship. The writing is good enough that the reader enjoys it without looking through it. But the details are too specific, the attention too careful, the warmth a few degrees too warm. An object is described with the tenderness reserved for a person. A gesture is given the weight of a confession. The Rimbaud at 40 provides enough sensory richness to make the details feel embodied without tipping into lyric immersion; the Burroughs at 20 contributes a faint unease, a sense that the social surface is being maintained at cost. The concealment cost is the gap between tone and content: the piece sounds fine, which is exactly the problem.

### Example Passages
- Forster, *A Passage to India*: Aziz shows Fielding the photograph of his dead wife -- an act of extraordinary intimacy routed through an absent woman. The emotional charge between the two men far exceeds what friendship warrants.
- Bishop, "The Shampoo": *"The still explosions on the rocks, / the lichens, grow / by spreading, gray, concentric shocks."* A poem about washing someone's hair that carries an eroticism legible only to those who know the "you" is Lota de Macedo Soares.
- Cavafy, "Days of 1908": Three stanzas document a youth's poverty and social degradation, then the final stanza pivots to recall his naked body "at the baths and on the beach" -- *"impeccably handsome, a miracle."* Desire is accessible only as elegy.

### Recommended Mask Types
- **Aesthetic Alibi**: the craft of the piece deflects attention from its content
- **Precision as Concealment**: the careful surface reads as skill, not survival
- **Confessional Redirect**: appears to confess something safe (nostalgia, friendship) while the real confession hides inside

### Recommended Signal Types
- **Overdetermined Detail**: an innocent object given too much weight
- **Sensory Surplus**: warmth, tenderness, attention disproportionate to the surface occasion
- **Negative Space**: the person or feeling conspicuously absent from an otherwise complete scene

### What to Avoid
Raw confession -- if the substrate breaches the surface, the "bright" quality collapses. Also avoid heavy systems language, bureaucratic parody, or overt paranoia; the Burroughs at 20 should register as social discomfort, not structural dread. Camp should stay restrained -- too much exaggeration will tip the polished surface into satire.

### Sample Encoding Schema Walkthrough
- **$SURFACE_STORY**: A post about helping a friend move apartments -- carrying boxes, choosing where the couch goes, ordering pizza. A warm slice-of-life anecdote about friendship and the intimacy of seeing someone's belongings in daylight.
- **$SUBSTRATE_STORY**: The speaker is in love with this friend. The inventory of belongings -- books, a chipped mug, a shirt left on a doorknob -- is an inventory of desire. Deciding where the couch goes is a fantasy of domestic life together. The pizza is the last meal before the speaker goes home alone.
- **$MASK_TYPE**: Aesthetic Alibi (the specificity of the details reads as good writing, not as longing)
- **$SIGNAL_TYPE**: Overdetermined Detail (the chipped mug is described with more care than a mug warrants)
- **$SURVEILLANCE_PRESSURE**: Mutual friends who would read the post; the friend themselves, who must not recognize the substrate
- **$PLAUSIBLE_DENIABILITY**: 3 -- genuinely ambiguous; most readers see warmth, the attuned reader sees ache
- **$AFFECT_COST**: The gap between tone and content -- the piece radiates comfort while describing heartbreak, and the reader may not notice

---

## Preset 5: Surveillance Fugue
**Dials**: Rimbaud 50 | Wilde 10 | Burroughs 60

### Primary Mechanisms Activated
1. **Surveillance as Third Entity** (Burroughs primary) -- the watcher as character, deforming every utterance
2. **Spatial Paranoia** (Burroughs primary) -- awareness of which spaces are safe and which are observed
3. **Pursuit / Agent Structures** (Burroughs primary) -- desire structured as operation with constant risk of failure
4. **Cage/Room/Prison Metaphor System** (Burroughs primary) -- enclosed spaces as the closet materialized
5. **Image Displacement** (Rimbaud moderate-to-primary) -- desire routed through landscape and weather
6. **Pronoun Drift / Referential Blur** (Rimbaud moderate) -- unstable pronouns, addressee unclear
7. **Negative Space as Content** (Rimbaud moderate/Burroughs moderate) -- strategic omission under pressure
8. **Temporal Dislocation** (Rimbaud moderate/Burroughs moderate) -- time fragmented by anxiety
9. **Violence as Displaced Eroticism** (Rimbaud moderate/Burroughs moderate) -- desire appearing as danger
10. **Insomnia and Night as Queer Time** (moderate across all) -- nighttime as when surveillance relaxes and the hidden life is possible

### Texture Description
Sensory but anxious. Landscape and body descriptions are interrupted by awareness of being observed. The surface reads as a piece about urban experience, digital life, or the feeling of being tracked. The Rimbaud at 50 provides enough lyric charge for the descriptions to feel embodied and intimate -- this is not clinical like Systems Dread. But the Burroughs at 60 keeps breaking in: who is watching becomes a character in the piece. Desire can only happen in stolen moments between checks. The low Wilde means no wit, no social polish, no performance -- the speaker is too exposed for masks. The concealment cost is that intimacy is always interrupted: every tender moment is cut short by the awareness that someone might be looking.

### Example Passages
- Burroughs, *Queer*: Lee's pursuit of Allerton through Mexico City -- *"desire as an operation with objectives, intelligence, and the constant risk of failure."* The pursuit is obsessive, methodical, and ultimately unsuccessful.
- Cavafy, "The City": *"You will always end up in this city."* The closet encoded as inescapable internal structure -- the city of desire and repression follows you wherever you go.
- Rimbaud, "Le Coeur vole": *"Mon triste coeur bave a la poupe"* -- the heart that has been violated, but the nature of the violation is never stated directly. The ellipsis is the event; the surveillance environment has made naming impossible.

### Recommended Mask Types
- **Systems Metaphor**: the piece is "about" the experience of being monitored, not about desire
- **Genre Displacement**: urban essay, digital-life meditation, architecture writing
- **Confessional Redirect**: the piece confesses anxiety or paranoia while desire hides inside the spatial awareness

### Recommended Signal Types
- **Structural Paranoia**: the feeling of being watched shapes the syntax itself
- **Sensory Surplus**: descriptions that carry erotic charge despite the anxious context
- **Negative Space**: what cannot be done or said because someone is watching

### What to Avoid
Social polish, satire, or camp -- the Wilde at 10 means the speaker has no protective performance. Epigrammatic wit will read as false. Also avoid pure clinical detachment (which belongs to Systems Dread at B85); the Rimbaud at 50 demands that the reader feel the body, not just the system.

### Sample Encoding Schema Walkthrough
- **$SURFACE_STORY**: A post about walking home at night -- the route chosen, the streets avoided, the phone's location shared with a friend. A piece about the city after dark and the calculations of safety.
- **$SUBSTRATE_STORY**: The speaker is walking home from someone's apartment. The route avoids the block where a coworker lives. The phone's shared location is turned off at midnight and back on at 6 a.m. The "calculations of safety" are about being seen, not about being hurt. The night city is the only space where desire is possible, and even that space is surveilled.
- **$MASK_TYPE**: Genre Displacement (reads as urban-safety essay)
- **$SIGNAL_TYPE**: Structural Paranoia (the route itself is a map of concealment) + Sensory Surplus (the night air, the streetlights, the warmth still on the speaker's skin -- too much sensation for a safety essay)
- **$SURVEILLANCE_PRESSURE**: Location-sharing apps; the coworker's window; the neighbor who notices when the speaker comes home
- **$PLAUSIBLE_DENIABILITY**: 2 -- the attuned reader will likely detect the substrate; the default reader sees a safety meditation
- **$AFFECT_COST**: Fragmented intimacy -- the piece holds tenderness and paranoia in the same sentence, and neither can fully occupy the space

---

## Preset 6: Archive Grief
**Dials**: Rimbaud 60 | Wilde 30 | Burroughs 30

### Primary Mechanisms Activated
1. **Negative Space as Content** (Rimbaud primary) -- the archive's gaps are the real subject
2. **Pronoun Drift / Referential Blur** (Rimbaud primary) -- the historical beloved's identity remains unstable
3. **Temporal Dislocation** (Rimbaud primary) -- past and present mixed; memory as the only access to desire
4. **Image Displacement** (Rimbaud primary) -- desire routed through objects, photographs, places
5. **Unspeakable Event** (Rimbaud primary) -- a void at the center of the historical record
6. **Confession Through Fictional Displacement** (all moderate-to-primary) -- emotional truth given through mediated voice
7. **Domestic Detail as Desire Code** (Wilde/Rimbaud moderate) -- objects from a shared life as evidence
8. **Precision as Armor** (Rimbaud/Burroughs moderate) -- archival exactness concealing emotional investment
9. **Posthumous Release Valve** (all moderate) -- the awareness that truth arrives only after it is safe
10. **Drafts-to-Final Erasure Pattern** (all moderate) -- the visible residue of what was removed

### Texture Description
Elegiac, layered, historically aware. The surface reads as a meditation on memory, loss, or place -- the kind of essay that accompanies a museum exhibition or a found photograph. The Rimbaud at 60 provides lyric warmth and sensory specificity: the reader feels the texture of old paper, the weight of an object held too long. The Wilde at 30 adds just enough formal craft to make the surface polished without being witty -- elegance without performance. The Burroughs at 30 contributes a low-level awareness that the archive itself is a surveillance apparatus: who kept what, who destroyed what, whose history was preserved and whose was erased. The substrate carries the specific grief of queer histories that were coded, misread, or destroyed. Signal comes through negative space -- what the archive does not contain. The concealment cost is fragmented intimacy: the past can only be accessed in pieces, and those pieces were selected by someone else's fear.

### Example Passages
- Bishop, "One Art": Seventeen drafts survive at Vassar. Early drafts specify *"the one I love"*; the final version reduces this to *"you"* -- maximally intimate, maximally ambiguous. The drafts-to-final erasure pattern is the mechanism made visible in the archive.
- Cavafy, "Hidden Things": *"From my actions and my writings, only a few will be found -- and those aren't enough."* A poem about concealment that never names what is concealed -- a map of the closet that never names the closet.
- Forster, *A Passage to India* (final lines): *"Why can't we be friends now?... It's what I want. It's what you want."* The horses swerve apart; the earth says *"No, not yet"*; the sky says *"No, not there."* The landscape itself refuses what two men desire.

### Recommended Mask Types
- **Precision as Concealment**: archival exactness reads as scholarship, not longing
- **Genre Displacement**: the essay as historical meditation, the found-object narrative
- **Confessional Redirect**: the piece confesses grief for "history" or "loss" while the specific queer loss hides inside

### Recommended Signal Types
- **Negative Space**: what the archive does not contain, what was redacted, what was burned
- **Overdetermined Detail**: an object from the archive given too much care in description
- **Sensory Surplus**: the material texture of documents, photographs, rooms -- too much tenderness for mere research

### What to Avoid
Present-tense rawness -- this preset works through temporal distance and mediation. Avoid the immediacy of Confessional Whisper or the paranoia of Surveillance Fugue. Camp and systems-level satire are wrong here; the tone should be elegiac, not ironic or clinical. The grief should feel earned through accumulation, not declared.

### Sample Encoding Schema Walkthrough
- **$SURFACE_STORY**: A post about finding a box of old letters at a thrift store -- someone's correspondence from the 1970s, full of weather reports and recipe exchanges. A meditation on what survives and what doesn't.
- **$SUBSTRATE_STORY**: The letters are between two women. The recipes are how they talked about love. The weather reports -- "it's been cold since you left" -- carry weight the writers could never have risked making explicit. The speaker recognizes the code because the speaker has written letters like this.
- **$MASK_TYPE**: Precision as Concealment (the archival attention reads as curiosity, not identification)
- **$SIGNAL_TYPE**: Negative Space (what the letters never say) + Overdetermined Detail (one letter folded differently from the others, as if reread many times)
- **$SURVEILLANCE_PRESSURE**: The awareness that these letters survived by accident; the knowledge that the speakers' own digital traces are less private than they think
- **$PLAUSIBLE_DENIABILITY**: 3 -- the historical frame provides distance; the personal identification is legible but deniable
- **$AFFECT_COST**: Fragmented intimacy -- the past is only available in pieces, and the speaker's recognition of the code is itself a grief: knowing what concealment looks like because you have practiced it

---

## Cross-Preset Comparison

### Mechanism Overlap
**Mechanisms appearing in 4+ presets** (these are the workhorses of the system):
- Negative Space as Content (all 6) -- the single most versatile mechanism; operates differently at each setting but never deactivates
- Pronoun Drift / Referential Blur (5 of 6 -- absent only from Defensive Wit where stable social identity is the point)
- Confession Through Fictional Displacement (5 of 6 -- universal because the double-channel model is itself fictional displacement)
- Public Mask vs Private Voice (4 of 6 -- core to any preset with Wilde above 20)

**Mechanisms unique to 1-2 presets**:
- Synesthetic Overload: only Confessional Whisper (requires R65+)
- Cut-Up as Deniability Machine: only Systems Dread (requires B80+)
- Epigrammatic Reversal: only Defensive Wit (requires W70+)
- Posthumous Release Valve / Drafts-to-Final Erasure: only Archive Grief (requires historical-archival framing)
- Addiction as Displacement: only Systems Dread and Surveillance Fugue (requires B50+)

### Dial Sensitivity
The mechanisms most sensitive to small dial changes -- where a 10-point shift creates the biggest texture change:

- **Rimbaud 40-60 range**: The shift from "some sensory detail" to "desire lives in the body" happens sharply here. At R40 (Bright Surface), descriptions are warm but controlled; at R60 (Archive Grief), they carry visible longing. The threshold for synesthetic overload sits around R65.
- **Wilde 20-40 range**: The shift from "no social performance" to "polished surface" happens here. At W20 (Confessional Whisper), the speaker is too exposed for masks; at W40, the surface begins to gleam. Camp only activates above W60.
- **Burroughs 30-60 range**: The shift from "faint unease" to "the system is watching" happens here. At B30 (Archive Grief), surveillance is historical context; at B60 (Surveillance Fugue), it is an active character. The clinical/manual tone only dominates above B75.

### Blending Guidance
To create custom presets, interpolate between adjacent pairs:

- **Between Confessional Whisper (R70/W20/B10) and Archive Grief (R60/W30/B30)**: Raise Burroughs and Wilde slightly while lowering Rimbaud. The texture shifts from raw immediacy to mediated, temporally layered intimacy. Good for pieces about memory that still feel embodied.
- **Between Defensive Wit (R10/W80/B30) and Bright Surface (R40/W60/B20)**: Raise Rimbaud while lowering Wilde. The texture shifts from social performance to warm anecdote. The jokes soften; the details deepen. Good for pieces that want to be inviting rather than dazzling.
- **Between Systems Dread (R20/W15/B85) and Surveillance Fugue (R50/W10/B60)**: Raise Rimbaud while lowering Burroughs. The texture shifts from clinical to embodied-anxious. The body reappears inside the system. Good for pieces about digital life that want the reader to feel their pulse.
- **Between any two non-adjacent presets**: Identify which dial moves the most and adjust in 10-point increments, testing the texture at each step. The transition zones are where the most surprising mechanisms activate -- the ones marked "Moderate" for multiple dials that only fully light up in combination.

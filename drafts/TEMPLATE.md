## Surface Notes

_What is this piece about on its face? What genre, form, or occasion justifies it?_



---

## Substrate Notes

_What is the real emotional plot? Who is the desire aimed at? What is the danger? What is the cost of being caught?_

## Encoding Self-Check

After drafting, walk through these questions:

1. **Two-channel test**: Can a straight colleague read this and find it complete? Can a queer reader find more?
2. **Mask integrity**: Does the surface story hold on its own, without needing the substrate to make sense?
3. **Signal presence**: Is there at least one moment where the substrate leaks through — not announced, but *felt*?
4. **Deniability check**: If someone hostile asked "what is this about?" — does your answer hold?
5. **Affect cost audit**: What feeling did the concealment distort? Where did you pull a punch, redirect tenderness, or convert longing into something safer? *That distortion is the piece's real material.*
6. **Dial consistency**: Do the dial settings match what you actually wrote? (High Rimbaud = sensory excess. High Wilde = wit surface. High Burroughs = systems/paranoia.)
7. **Safety test**: If it feels safe to post, it doesn't belong in Field I yet. Where is the risk?

# Encoding Worksheet — The 7-Variable Schema

A walkthrough for applying the QV33R encoding schema to a single piece.
Work through each variable in order. The questions force decisions;
the examples show how different settings produce different textures.

---

## How to Use This

1. Start with a feeling, image, or situation — not a thesis.
2. Walk through each variable below, answering the questions honestly.
3. Set your dials (Rimbaud / Wilde / Burroughs) based on where your answers land.
4. Draft the fragment using `TEMPLATE.md`.
5. Return to the self-check questions at the end of the template.

## Variable 1: $SURFACE_STORY

**Question**: What does a default reader — someone not looking for queer content — take away from this piece?

**The rule**: The surface must be *genuinely good*. Not a decoy, not a throwaway. It must work as a complete piece on its own. If the surface is weak, the double-channel collapses into a puzzle with an obvious answer.

| Dial Setting | Surface Tends Toward |
|---|---|
| High Rimbaud | Visionary fragment, sensory catalogue, landscape meditation |
| High Wilde | Social observation, wit, anecdote, cultural commentary |
| High Burroughs | Systems critique, institutional observation, paranoid realism |

**Examples at different intensities**:
- *Low intensity*: "A post about missing someone." (Too thin — no surface architecture.)
- *Medium*: "A post about the particular way a city smells after rain, and how smell carries memory." (Has texture, stands alone.)
- *High*: "A post about the architecture of waiting rooms — the way certain public spaces are designed to make you feel observed." (Rich surface, invites re-reading.)

## Variable 2: $SUBSTRATE_STORY

**Question**: What is the real emotional plot? Who is the desire aimed at? What is at stake if the wrong person reads correctly?

**The rule**: Never announce the substrate. The queer reader *infers* it from the costs of concealment — the distortions, the pulled punches, the moments of excess.

**Diagnostic questions**:
- Is there a specific person or situation driving this piece, or is it abstract?
- What would happen if the substrate were made explicit? (If nothing — the stakes are too low.)
- Where in the piece does the substrate press hardest against the surface?

---

## Variable 3: $MASK_TYPE

**Question**: What formal or rhetorical structure provides the cover story? Why is the surface reading *credible*?

**Available mask types** (from the research corpus):

| Mask Type | How It Works | Source Author |
|---|---|---|
| **Voyant Alibi** | Philosophical framework justifies all transgression as epistemological experiment | Rimbaud |
| **Aesthetic Alibi** | Art-for-art's-sake doctrine makes content "about beauty, not confession" | Wilde |
| **Systems Metaphor** | Desire is translated into impersonal systems vocabulary (addiction, bureaucracy, contagion) | Burroughs |
| **Genre Displacement** | Fairy tale, myth, sci-fi, or landscape poem provides genre alibi | Rimbaud, Burroughs |
| **Confessional Redirect** | The piece appears confessional about something else (grief, addiction, loneliness) while the real confession hides inside | Baldwin, Cavafy |
| **Camp** | If everything is performed, nothing is sincere — the truth hides in the exaggeration | Wilde |
| **Precision as Concealment** | Extreme descriptive accuracy creates an appearance of objectivity that masks the emotional investment | Bishop, Forster |

**Question to ask yourself**: If someone said "this is clearly about [queer desire]" — what is your defense? That defense is your mask type.

---

## Variable 4: $SIGNAL_TYPE

**Question**: How does the substrate leak through the mask? What makes the queer-attuned reader *feel* something the default reader doesn't?

**Available signal types** (from the research corpus):

| Signal Type | What It Looks Like | Mechanism Used |
|---|---|---|
| **Sensory Surplus** | A description that carries *too much* charge — too much color, heat, texture, tenderness | Pronoun Drift, Negative Space |
| **Recognition Trigger** | Shared vocabulary, coded reference, in-group knowledge that the attuned reader catches | Camp as Encryption |
| **Structural Paranoia** | The text's own anxiety — checking who's watching, who's listening, the feeling of being observed | Surveillance as Entity |
| **Pronoun Drift** | Unstable or ambiguous pronouns that refuse to fix the beloved's gender or the speaker's position | Pronoun Drift / Referential Blur |
| **Negative Space** | What is conspicuously *absent* — the thing not named, the detail skipped, the sentence that stops short | Negative Space as Content |
| **Overdetermined Detail** | An innocent detail given too much weight — a color, an object, a gesture that means more than it should | Overdetermined Innocent Details |

**Question to ask yourself**: Where in this piece would a queer friend pause and look at you differently?

---

## Variable 5: $SURVEILLANCE_PRESSURE

**Question**: What external force makes concealment necessary *in this specific piece*? Who is watching?

**The rule**: Contemporary writing has *different* surveillance pressures than the anchor authors faced. Map your actual situation, not a historical one.

**Contemporary surveillance sources**:
- **Social media audience**: Followers, algorithms, screenshot culture, context collapse
- **Family**: Parents, siblings, extended family who follow you online
- **Professional**: Employer, colleagues, industry reputation, hiring committees
- **Community**: Religious community, neighborhood, cultural expectations
- **Legal/State**: Laws, immigration status, military service, custody
- **Self**: Internalized shame, the inner censor, the voice that says "this is too much"

**Diagnostic**: Write one sentence naming exactly who you're hiding from and why. (This sentence never appears in the piece. It's the engine under the hood.)

---

## Variable 6: $PLAUSIBLE_DENIABILITY

**Question**: How does the text defend itself against hostile interpretation? What is the gap between what a reader can *prove* and what the text actually carries?

**Deniability strategies** (from the research corpus):

| Strategy | How It Works |
|---|---|
| **Obscurity** | Texts that resist interpretation cannot be pinned to specific confessions |
| **Genre alibi** | "It's fiction / poetry / a character study / satire" |
| **Universalizing** | "Everyone feels this way" — desire framed as general human condition |
| **Irony layer** | "I was joking / exaggerating / being dramatic" |
| **Displacement** | The piece is "about" something else (a city, a season, an object) |
| **Character distribution** | No single character = the author |

**Calibration test**: Rate your deniability 1-5.
- **1** = Transparent. Anyone reading carefully would know.
- **3** = Ambiguous. Two honest readers could disagree about what the piece "really" means.
- **5** = Sealed. Only a reader with very specific context would detect the substrate.

For Field I work, aim for **2-4**. Below 2, the double-channel collapses. Above 4, the substrate may be too buried to land.

## Variable 7: $AFFECT_COST

**Question**: What does the concealment *do* to the emotional register of the writing? What feeling did you distort, and how?

**The rule**: This is the most important variable. The affect cost is where the piece's real power lives. The distortion *is* the content.

**Common affect costs** (from the research corpus):

| Cost Pattern | What Happens | Source Author |
|---|---|---|
| **Tonal Instability** | The text can't hold a feeling steady — tenderness undercut by irony, longing interrupted by violence or comedy | Rimbaud |
| **Emotional Displacement Upward** | Everything is made lighter, wittier, brighter than the substrate requires — pleasure replaces pain | Wilde |
| **Systematic Mechanization** | Tenderness becomes procedure, longing becomes need, intimacy becomes transaction | Burroughs |
| **Fragmented Intimacy** | Intimacy only in flashes — never sustained, always interrupted | Rimbaud, Cavafy |
| **Abrupt Endings** | Desire that can't arrive at its object arrives at destruction, silence, or departure instead | Rimbaud, Bishop |
| **Precision as Armor** | Extreme control of language as defense against emotional exposure | Bishop, Forster |

**Diagnostic**: After you draft, find the moment where you *most* wanted to say the real thing directly. What did you do instead? That substitution — that swerve — is your affect cost. It's also probably the best line in the piece.

## Sample Dial Configurations

Pre-set configurations for different emotional registers. Use as starting points, not prescriptions.

### "Confessional Whisper"
```
rimbaud_drift: 70
wilde_mask: 20
burroughs_control: 10
```
**Texture**: Sensory, intimate, fragmented. Language that feels like remembering a body. Surface reads as lyric personal essay. Substrate leaks through sensory surplus — descriptions that carry more charge than their object warrants. Low wit, low systems. The concealment cost is tonal instability: tenderness keeps getting interrupted.

### "Defensive Wit"
```
rimbaud_drift: 10
wilde_mask: 80
burroughs_control: 30
```
**Texture**: Sharp, social, performative. Surface reads as cultural commentary or satirical observation. Substrate hides in the precision of the jokes — what is being mocked reveals what is being protected. High ornament, moderate paranoia. The concealment cost is emotional displacement upward: everything sounds funnier than it feels.

### "Systems Dread"
```
rimbaud_drift: 20
wilde_mask: 15
burroughs_control: 85
```
**Texture**: Clinical, procedural, uneasy. Surface reads as institutional critique or bureaucratic observation. Substrate leaks through structural paranoia — the feeling of being watched, catalogued, processed. Low lyric, low wit. The concealment cost is systematic mechanization: every human feeling is translated into the vocabulary of systems.

### "Bright Surface, Dark Water"
```
rimbaud_drift: 40
wilde_mask: 60
burroughs_control: 20
```
**Texture**: Polished, warm, sociable — but something is wrong underneath. Surface reads as a well-crafted personal anecdote or lifestyle piece. Substrate hides in overdetermined details: an object described with too much care, a gesture given too much weight. The concealment cost is the gap between tone and content: the piece sounds fine, which is exactly the problem.

### "Surveillance Fugue"
```
rimbaud_drift: 50
wilde_mask: 10
burroughs_control: 60
```
**Texture**: Sensory but anxious. Landscape and body descriptions interrupted by awareness of being observed. Surface reads as a piece about urban experience or digital life. Substrate leaks through the surveillance-as-entity mechanism: who is watching becomes a character in the piece. The concealment cost is that intimacy can only happen in stolen moments between checks.

### "Archive Grief"
```
rimbaud_drift: 60
wilde_mask: 30
burroughs_control: 30
```
**Texture**: Elegiac, layered, historically aware. Surface reads as a meditation on memory, loss, or place. Substrate carries the specific grief of queer histories that were erased, coded, or misread. Signal comes through negative space — what the archive doesn't contain. The concealment cost is fragmented intimacy: the past can only be accessed in pieces.

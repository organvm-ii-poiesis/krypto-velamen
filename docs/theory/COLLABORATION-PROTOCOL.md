# Collaboration Protocol: Co-Authoring the Substrate
## Multi-User Encoding and Peer Recognition

---

## 1. The Core Objective
To facilitate the collaborative construction of the queer archive while maintaining the "Double-Channel" integrity. Collaboration in KRYPTO-VELAMEN is not about consensus, but about **Shared Resistance**.

---

## 2. Co-Authoring (The Shared Substrate)
When two or more users co-author a fragment, they engage in a "Shared Substrate" operation.

### A. The Invitation
- A user initiates a draft and generates a **Substrate Key**.
- The key is shared via the encrypted "Signal" DM service.
- The co-author enters the key to gain access to the `$SUBSTRATE_STORY` layer.

### B. The Conflict Layer
- Co-authors are encouraged to maintain different `$DIAL` settings.
- *Example*: Author A (Wilde 80) writes the surface wit; Author B (Burroughs 80) writes the systems-paranoia substrate.
- The resulting text must satisfy both authors' constraints simultaneously.

---

## 3. Peer Review (The Witness Protocol)
In KRYPTO-VELAMEN, peer review is renamed the **Witness Protocol**. It focuses on "Recognition" rather than "Correction."

### A. The Projection Field
- Reviewers (Witnesses) do not edit the text.
- They contribute to the `$AUDIENCE_PROJECTION` field in the fragment metadata.
- Witnesses record what they "detected" in the substrate.

### B. Verification of the Veil
- A fragment is considered "Archived" (Final) only after a Witness verifies that the `$SURFACE_STORY` is complete without the `$SUBSTRATE_STORY`, but the substrate is "felt."

## 4. Interaction Metrics
The "Poiesis Dashboard" tracks collaboration through these metrics:
- **Resonance Rate**: The correlation between an author's intended substrate and a Witness's projection.
- **Exposure Depth**: The frequency of migration between Field I and Field II (The Flip).
- **Network Density**: The number of shared nodes in the Knowledge Graph between users.

---

## 5. Ethical Stewardship
- **Right to Erasure**: Any co-author can request the redaction of their contribution.
- **Pseudonym Integrity**: Collaboration must not compromise the "Mask" settings of any participant.

# Narratological Lens Integration
## The Geometry of the Double-Channel Text

---

## 1. The Core Objective
To integrate the **Narratological Algorithmic Lenses** from **Organ I (THEORIA)** into the **KRYPTO-VELAMEN** platform. This provides a structural layer of analysis, mapping how the "Double-Channel" text is bound together through causal logic and narrative movement.

---

## 2. Theoretical Alignment
If the **Atomizer** (Organ I) provides the *Physics* (Molecular Particles), then the **Narratological Lenses** provide the *Geometry*.

### The Structural Hypothesis
A successful double-channel text requires the same structural integrity as a professional screenplay. The `$SUBSTRATE_STORY` must not be a series of disconnected hints ("And Then"), but a tight chain of consequences ("Therefore/But").

## 3. Mapping Lenses to Author Clusters

| Cluster | Narrative Signature | Recommended Lens |
|---------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Cluster A (Lyric)** | Time-pressure, sensory overload | **Tarkovsky (Time-Pressure)** |
| **Cluster B (Style)** | Comedy, irony, performance | **Larry David (Comedy Geometry)** |
| **Cluster C (Systems)** | Cold, procedural, units | **Kubrick (Non-Submersible Units)** |
| **Cluster D (Bridges)** | Layered obstacles, interiority | **Waller-Bridge (Layered Obstacles)** |
| **Cluster E (Visibility)** | Mythic transformation | **Bharata Muni (Rasa-Bhava)** |

## 4. The Lens Engine (`services/lens-engine`)
The Lens Engine provides structural diagnostics:
- **Causal Binding Index**: Measures the ratio of `THEREFORE/BUT` connectors in the substrate.
- **Reorderability Test**: Identifies if scenes can be moved without damaging the substrate logic.
- **Layered Obstacle Check**: Ensures every scene contains at least three things going on (Surface, Substrate, and Systemic).

## 5. Interaction: The Script Doctor Agent
The **Script Doctor** persona in the `agent-swarm` uses these lenses to provide structural feedback. It does not critique the "feeling," but the **Geometry** of the hiding.

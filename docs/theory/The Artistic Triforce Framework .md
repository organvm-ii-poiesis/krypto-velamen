# The Artistic Triforce Framework

## Why an artist’s “total archive” needs more than chronology

Your **Artistic Triforce Manifesto** proposes a tripartite sorting system meant to “hold” an entire career across mediums by grouping projects into three polarities: present-focused autobiographical/persona work, present-focused underworld/dream work, and past–future mythology/canon work. fileciteturn0file0

That ambition addresses a real archival problem: chronological or medium-only filing systems preserve time and format, but they routinely fail at the task you actually care about—revealing *recurrence* and *intent* across decades, genres, and media. In archival theory, “original order” is the organization established by the creator; it is preserved because it carries evidential relationships and context. citeturn6search0 But archives also warn against reorganizing records by subject as the primary structure (a core implication of “respect des fonds” and provenance-based arrangement), because doing so can destroy creator-context. citeturn6search5turn6search9 The practical way around this tension—crucial for your system—is to keep creator-order intact while adding a *secondary descriptive layer* (metadata, indexing, cross-references) that supports thematic retrieval without dismantling the evidence trail. citeturn6search0turn6search9

Contemporary artist-career documentation guidance converges on that same conclusion: a usable inventory is less about a single “correct” shelf order and more about building an adaptable, queryable record that can serve different future users (you, collaborators, galleries, museums, estates). citeturn5search3 The Triforce concept can be understood as a *deliberate metadata spine*—a stable top-level lens for meaning—rather than a mandate to reshuffle everything into three folders. citeturn6search0turn5search3

## Why a three-pole model is structurally plausible

A three-part architecture is not arbitrary; it has precedents in how major interpretive traditions model the psyche, meaning, and time.

In analytical psychology, the “persona” is explicitly framed as a socially oriented mask mediating between individual consciousness and society—a definition that strongly resembles your “present-focused autobiographical & persona-based” lane. citeturn0search4 The “shadow” (famously defined as “the thing a person has no wish to be”) models a second lane: material that is disowned, repressed, feared, or otherwise kept out of the persona’s self-presentation—an obvious conceptual ally to your “dream/underworld” polarity. citeturn0search5 A third layer in this tradition is the collective unconscious, described as containing archetypes—primordial, cross-cultural pattern-forms that recur in images and ideas—which aligns with your “religion, mythology, canon” polarity (where the work reaches beyond the personal-now into inherited symbolic structures). citeturn0search2turn0search6

A different lineage—psychoanalytic and structural—also uses a stabilizing triad. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy summarizes entity["people","Jacques Lacan","french psychoanalyst"]’s three registers (Imaginary, Symbolic, Real) as “three fundamental dimensions of psychical subjectivity.” citeturn1search2 Even if you do not adopt Lacanian commitments, the formal point matters: triads recur because they allow (a) an identity/presentation layer, (b) a resistant or disavowed layer, and (c) a law/structure/history layer to be kept distinct while still interdependent. citeturn1search2

Triads also appear in semiotics: entity["people","Charles Sanders Peirce","american philosopher"] distinguishes signs as icons, indices, and symbols depending on whether meaning arises via resemblance, real connection, or convention. citeturn6search7turn6search3 This matters for your system because your lanes can be treated as different “sign regimes”: autobiographical work tends to trade in resemblance and direct reference (indexical traces of lived life), underworld work leans into displaced symbols and uncanny indices, and myth/canon work often prioritizes conventional symbolic systems (scripture, ritual, inherited narrative forms). citeturn6search7turn0search2turn0search6

Finally, the past–future lane you describe has a well-researched anchor in myth studies: “sacred time” is contrasted with ordinary (“profane”) time, and festivals/rituals are widely described as returns or re-actualizations of primordial mythic time. citeturn1search0turn1search1 This supports your intuition that some projects are not “present reportage” or “present nightmare” but are built to operate in a different temporal mode—epochal, cyclical, exemplary, canonical. citeturn1search1turn0search6

## The three polarities as operational categories rather than genres

Your manifesto already emphasizes a key design choice: this is *not* a medium-based theory and is only loosely genre-correlated. fileciteturn0file0 Treating the Triforce as a **classification of creative intention** (not just surface genre) is what will let it scale across an entire career.

A practical operationalization is to define each polarity by a small set of decision rules.

**Conscious polarity (present-external, self and persona):** work whose primary claim on the audience is “this is me / my life / my position / my witness,” including essays, documentation, memoir-structures, self-portraiture, and deliberate persona construction. The Jungian persona definition is especially useful here: an adaptive mask relating the self to the social world, a “system of relations” between consciousness and society. citeturn0search4

**Subconscious polarity (present-internal, shadow and dream):** work whose primary claim is “this is what is beneath my waking story,” including dream logic, dread, taboo, fragmentation, doubling, and masks used to expose rather than perform identity. Jung’s “shadow” concept offers a tight anchor: it is defined around rejected material and the consequences of failing to acknowledge it. citeturn0search5 Importantly, this lane is not “horror-only”; it is any project where the governing method is descent, displacement, or confrontation with disowned psychic content. citeturn0search5turn1search2

**Temporal polarity (past–future, archetype and canon):** work whose primary claim is “this participates in something older/larger or not-yet,” including religion-coded projects, mythic retellings, historical/canonical dialogue, speculative futures, and academic/theoretical “lineage building.” Your manifesto explicitly frames this as religion, mythology, canon, and it is well supported by scholarship describing sacred/mythic time as a recoverable “primordial” time made present through cultural forms. fileciteturn0file0 citeturn1search1turn1search0 This polarity also maps naturally to Jung’s archetypes and collective unconscious (universal pattern-forms expressed in images and ideas across cultures). citeturn0search2turn0search6

The key insight is that these are best treated as **attractor zones** rather than rigid bins: a project can be “mostly Conscious with Subconscious undertow,” or “Temporal scaffolding with Conscious autobiography inside it.” Triadic frameworks are especially good at supporting this kind of mixed membership while keeping the extremes intelligible. citeturn1search2turn6search7turn0search4

## What real-world creative careers and archives suggest

Your motivating observation—artists repeating “the same work” in different forms—matches how criticism often approaches large filmographies and bibliographies: not as a pile of products, but as a patterned system where recurring motifs, preoccupations, and signatures show up across changing genres. Auteur theory formalizes this in cinema by treating the director as the major creative force whose personal style and thematic preoccupations can unify a body of work. citeturn3search2

This becomes especially relevant at “career scale.” entity["people","Andrew Sarris","american film critic"]’s widely cited auteur framing includes the notion of “interior meaning” emerging from tension between a creator’s personality and their material—an idea that effectively describes what your sorting system is trying to make searchable. citeturn3search3 The Triforce lens can be understood as a concrete way to index that “interior meaning” across time: the same core preoccupation may recur as social self-accounting (Conscious), as nightmare/doubling (Subconscious), or as mythic/canonical structure (Temporal). citeturn3search2turn3search3

Archival evidence supports the “micro-elements into macro-system” premise. The archival collection at entity["organization","University of the Arts London","london, uk"] describing the working materials of entity["known_celebrity","Stanley Kubrick","film director"] explicitly includes scripts and extensive research materials (books, magazines, photographs), along with production documents (schedules, continuity material) and other artifacts. citeturn5search0 This is a public example of how a major creator’s practice generates huge volumes of intermediate material, and why a career-holding system must model drafts, research, and variants—not only finished “works.” citeturn5search0turn5search3

Similarly, the entity["organization","University at Buffalo","buffalo, ny, us"] catalog description of entity["people","James Joyce","irish novelist"]’s Finnegans Wake notebooks notes that one manuscript is a rare example containing both sorted/recycled notes from other notebooks (“second-order” notes) and new notes. citeturn5search6 That is essentially a documented instance of a world-class creator building a meta-layer of organization that transforms fragments into a larger architectonic system—very close to your “digest” step. citeturn5search6

A third example shows how one “living work” can dominate an entire career: entity["people","Walt Whitman","american poet"] repeatedly revised entity["book","Leaves of Grass","whitman poetry 1855"] across many editions from 1855 through the final “deathbed” edition era, expanding it dramatically (from a small first edition to a compendium approaching 400 poems). citeturn4search16turn4search17 This kind of lifelong revision is exactly the scenario where a sorting system must track versions, motif persistence, and category drift over time—i.e., where “one work” can still contain all three polarities across different strata. citeturn4search16turn5search3

Even at the level of public discourse about prolific creators, the names you invoked—entity["people","Stephen King","american novelist"], entity["known_celebrity","Woody Allen","film director"], entity["known_celebrity","Quentin Tarantino","film director"], entity["known_celebrity","Andrei Tarkovsky","film director"]—are routinely discussed in terms of repeating thematic obsessions and signature modes rather than in terms of medium alone. citeturn3search2turn4search7turn8search3 And the “writes the same book over and over” idea you referenced via entity["known_celebrity","Bill Maher","american comedian"] is best interpreted as an informal version of the same critical heuristic: careers have attractors; artists revisit them; the interesting question is how and why. citeturn3search2turn3search3

## Building the Triforce as a scalable knowledge system

If the goal is not just sorting but *holding a career*, the system needs two layers: a stable conceptual layer (your three polarities) and a flexible descriptive layer (facets, relationships, versioning) that can grow indefinitely without collapsing.

A proven approach in information organization is **faceted classification**: instead of forcing every item into a single hierarchy, you describe items across multiple independent dimensions (“facets”), enabling many valid paths of retrieval. citeturn2search5turn2search14 This is directly relevant because the Triforce is one very strong facet (creative intention / psychic-temporal mode), but it cannot replace other essential facets like medium, date, collaborators, location, status, and recurrence. citeturn2search5turn5search3

The library science lineage behind facets is explicit about using a small set of fundamental categories to generate flexible combinations; entity["people","Shiyali Ramamrita Ranganathan","indian librarian"]’s Colon Classification is the classic example, commonly summarized via the PMEST categories (Personality, Matter, Energy, Space, Time). citeturn2search14turn2search5 You do not need PMEST verbatim, but the design principle transfers: keep the number of top-level primitives small, then allow composition. citeturn2search14turn2search8

A practical “career-holding” schema can be built by adapting established cultural heritage metadata patterns rather than inventing everything from scratch:

- A baseline descriptive vocabulary can start with the 15-element Dublin Core set maintained by the entity["organization","Dublin Core Metadata Initiative","metadata standards org"] (title, creator, date, type, format, subject, etc.), then extend with your Triforce-specific fields. citeturn6search2  
- For modeling versions and embodiments (concept → expression/edition → file/object), the entity["organization","International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions","library standards body"] describes its Library Reference Model as a high-level entity–relationship conceptual model consolidating earlier bibliographic models. citeturn2search6turn2search12  
- If you want a graph/knowledge-base layer that can express rich relationships (“this dream-note influenced that script draft which later became a performance”), the CIDOC CRM positions itself as a tool for information integration across cultural heritage data. citeturn2search3turn2search7  

The result is a system where Triforce is a **core interpretive tag**, but the archive stays computable, preservable, and interoperable. citeturn2search5turn6search2turn2search3

A minimal record structure that respects archival best practices would look like this (conceptually):

- Keep **storage order** close to creator workflow (project folders, notebooks, shoots, semesters), consistent with “original order,” and avoid destructive reorganizations. citeturn6search0turn6search9  
- Add a **Triforce field** that can be either a single dominant polarity or a weighted triple (e.g., 0–100 / 0–100 / 0–100 summing to 100) to represent mixed-mode projects without forcing false purity. citeturn2search5turn1search2  
- Attach **linkable IDs** so that “micro-elements” (notes, sketches, voice memos, bibliographies, dream logs) can be related to “macro-works” (released pieces, exhibitions, dissertations) without losing provenance and version history. citeturn5search3turn5search0  

This aligns with career-documentation guidance that emphasizes adaptability and future-proofing in inventory systems rather than one-time static filing. citeturn5search3turn5search7

## Stress-testing the framework and making it evolve without breaking

A triadic framework succeeds when it stays stable while your output mutates. To keep the Triforce “living” instead of becoming a brittle ideology, the tests should be operational.

First, the framework should support your manifesto’s workflow logic—ingest, digest, suggest—without forcing the archive into a single reading. fileciteturn0file0 “Digest” should be repeatable: you should be able to reclassify a project later (or revise its weights) without corrupting historical records. That implies explicit versioning and audit trails, which is consistent with how modern inventory guidance frames long-term career documentation. citeturn5search3turn2search6

Second, define edge-case rules up front. The most common failure mode for systems like this is confusing **genre** with **polarity**. Myth can be used as present-day autobiography; autobiography can be written as speculative scripture; academic work can function as underworld confession. Treat these as expected hybrids, not exceptions, and let your scheme represent mixture rather than forcing a single label. Triadic models are particularly suited to “mutual dependence” rather than strict separation (a point explicitly emphasized in Lacan’s later triadic thinking). citeturn1search2

Third, keep the psychological language in its proper domain: metaphor and interpretive heuristic, not diagnosis. Jungian “persona” and “shadow” are conceptual tools describing relations between social presentation and disowned material; they are useful for creative cataloging precisely because they are about patterns of representation and repression, not clinical labeling. citeturn0search4turn0search5

Finally, validate the system by whether it improves retrieval and planning. A working Triforce archive should let you answer questions like: “Show me everything that uses masks to dismantle identity,” “Show me the mythic lineages I keep returning to,” or “Which polarity has been neglected for two years?”—while still preserving original order and provenance. The archival principle is clear: preserve creator context at the storage layer, then meet modern research needs via cataloging and indexing. citeturn6search0turn6search9

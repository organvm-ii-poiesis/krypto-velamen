# Porpentine Charity Heartscape: Hypertext, Trash, and the Community of the Wound
## Deep Research Report (Cluster F: The Digital Commons)

---

## A) $EXEC_SUMMARY
Porpentine Charity Heartscape (1987–) represents the "Platform" turn in queer encoding. Through Twine games like *Howling Dogs* and *With Those We Love Alive*, she transformed the hypertext link into a mechanism of somatic encoding. Her "trash femme" aesthetic creates a community of the "disposable," where shared trauma and "bad affect" function as the substrate of belonging. She bridges the "Author" (Cluster C) and the "Platform" (Cluster F) by building tools (Twine macros) that allow others to encode their own survival.

## B) $CORPUS_MAP
- **Howling Dogs** (2012): The breakthrough Twine game exploring confinement and escapism.
- **With Those We Love Alive** (2014): A "queer fable" requiring the player to draw sigils on their own skin.
- **Hot Allostatic Load** (2015): Theoretical essay defining "trash femme" aesthetics and the biology of trauma.
- **Psycho Nymph Exile** (2015): Novella fusing cyberpunk with the somatic reality of trans experience.

---

## C) $ENCODING_SCHEMA (Platform Mode)
- **$SURFACE_STORY**: Cyberpunk dystopias, "skull-gun" sci-fi, and surreal body horror.
- **$SUBSTRATE_STORY**: The specific somatic reality of trans feminine existence, hormone replacement, and social ostracization.
- **$MASK_TYPE**: **The Hypertext Labyrinth.** The "mask" is the non-linear structure itself; the player must "navigate" the trauma to understand it.
- **$SIGNAL_TYPE**: **The Glitch/The Sigil.** Signal leaks through broken code, text that refuses to render, and instructions to mark the physical body.
- **$SURVEILLANCE_PRESSURE**: **The Medical/Social Gaze.** The "allostatic load" of being trans in a hostile environment.
- **$PLAUSIBLE_DENIABILITY**: **High (Genre).** The "weird fiction" label protects the autobiographical core.
- **$AFFECT_COST**: **Disposability.** The exhaustion of being "human trash" and the refusal to be rehabilitated.

## D) $MECHANICS_ATLAS

1. **Hypertext as Somatic Link**
   - *Definition*: Links that describe physical sensations ("click to feel the needle").
   - *Concealment Function*: Routes pain through interface mechanics.
   - *Cost*: The player becomes complicit in the pain.
   - *Example*: *With Those We Love Alive*.

2. **Trash Femme Aesthetics**
   - *Definition*: Embracing "garbage" materials, glitch, and "bad" feelings.
   - *Concealment Function*: If the work looks like "trash," the normative gaze ignores it.
   - *Cost*: Rejection by "high art" institutions (until recently).
   - *Example*: *Hot Allostatic Load*.

3. **Sigil Magic (Physical/Digital Bridge)**
   - *Definition*: Instructing the player to draw on their skin during the game.
   - *Visibility Function*: Breaks the screen barrier; the "archive" enters the body.
   - *Cost*: The mark is temporary but the memory is somatic.
   - *Example*: The "Empress" sigils in *WTWLA*.

## E) $HISTORICAL_CONSTRAINT_LAYER
- **The "Twine Revolution" (2012–2015)**: A democratization of game design that allowed marginalized voices to bypass gatekeepers.
- **GamerGate (2014)**: The violent backlash against "non-gamer" narratives, creating a specific surveillance pressure on Porpentine.

---

## F) $RECEPTION_AND_MISREADS
1. **The "Empathy Game" Misread**: Seeing her work as a tool for cis people to "understand" transness, rather than a weapon for trans survival.
2. **The "Retro" Misread**: Focusing on the text-adventure format as nostalgia rather than accessibility.

---

## G) $CREATOR_TRANSLATION
1. **Make the Tool the Message**: If the platform excludes you, build a new one (or hack an old one).
2. **Use Trash**: The discarded parts of culture (glitch, spam, junk data) are the safest materials for queer building.
3. **Mark the Body**: Don't let the digital remain on the screen. Force the user to feel it.

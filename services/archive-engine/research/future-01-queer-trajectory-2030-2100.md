# Future History: Queer Trajectory 2030-2100
## Cluster G: Temporal Antagonism

## 1. Timeline of the Interval

### The Platform Collapse (2030-2040)
- **The Event**: The "Great Deplatforming" where centralized social media fractals into paid, verified enclaves.
- **Queer Response**: The resurgence of "Dark Web" forums and mesh networks (The Digital Commons).
- **Key Artifact**: The "Signal" archives—encrypted drives passed by hand.

### The Somatic Return (2040-2060)
- **Context**: Climate migration forces new forms of communal living.
- **Queer Life**: A return to "Radical Faggotry" and "Butch/Femme" roles as survival mechanisms in resource-scarce environments.
- **Tech**: AR layers used to mark safe houses in physical space ("Augmented Hiding").

### The Mycelial Web (2060-2100)
- **The Shift**: Bio-computing allows for "Somatic Linking" (Porpentine's vision realized).
- **The Archive**: KRYPTO-VELAMEN becomes a "living" entity, hosted not on servers but in the shared memory of the network.

## 2. Research Questions
1. How does the "Closet" evolve when surveillance is biological?
2. What is the role of "Myth" when history is rewritten by AI?
3. Can the "Double-Channel" text survive direct neural interface?

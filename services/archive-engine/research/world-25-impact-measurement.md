# World Research Brief: Measuring Impact and Gathering Feedback
## Topic 25: The Feedback Loop

---

## 1. Topic Scope
This brief outlines the methodologies for assessing the impact of the QV33R project on its participants and the broader community. It focuses on collecting feedback ethically, measuring emotional resonance, and evaluating the project's educational and archival value within its "worlds."

## 2. Reality vs Artifice Decomposition

| Subtopic | World A (Reality/Material) | World B (Artifice/Mediated) |
|----------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Feedback** | Interviews, focus groups, and physical surveys. | Digital metrics, user engagement data, and virtual polls. |
| **Resonance** | Somatic and psychological impact on the user. | The "Algorithm" of recognition: what gets shared and saved. |
| **Archive** | Real-world usage of the repository by researchers. | The "Interactive Dashboard" as a tool for tracking knowledge growth. |
| **Privacy** | Ethical handling of personal data and "Risk Flags." | The "Masked" feedback loop: collecting data without doxxing. |

## 3. Timeline
- **2015–2018**: Early experiments in "Digital Ethnograhy" for online communities.
- **2020**: Development of "Participatory Design" frameworks for social VR.
- **2022**: Increased focus on "Emotional Impact" metrics beyond clicks and views.
- **2023**: Systematic reviews of "Feedback Ethics" in marginalized digital spaces.
- **2024**: Emergence of "AI-Assisted Analysis" for qualitative user data.
- **2025**: The "Poiesis Dashboard" integrates impact tracking into the workspace.

## 4. Key Concepts Glossary
- **Qualitative Impact**: Measuring meaning and resonance rather than just numbers. *Matters to QV33R*: Validates the "Artistic" goal.
- **Participatory Design**: Involving users in the creation of the feedback loop itself. *Matters to QV33R*: The "Public Creation" principle in assessment.
- **Ethical Data Handling**: Ensuring participant safety and privacy (Topic 8). *Matters to QV33R*: The "Goverance" requirement.
- **Emotional Resonance**: The degree to which the text "lands" with its intended audience. *Matters to QV33R*: The ultimate metric of the "Signal."

## 5. Case Studies
1. **The VRChat Testimony Collection**: Gathering qualitative stories from "Gaytopia" users. *Teaches QV33R*: How "Artifice" (the avatar) enables more honest "Reality" (the story).
2. **Inclusive Feedback Frameworks**: Studies on gathering data from traditionally understudied regions. *Teaches QV33R*: The "Global" requirement for measurement.
3. **The Poiesis Dashboard**: Using repository stats to track the "Needle Moving." *Teaches QV33R*: How the "Instrument" can measure its own growth.

## 7. Research Gaps
- Measuring the impact of "Hidden" vs. "Visible" encoding on the user.
- The tension between "Data Collection" and "User Anonymity."
- Next query: "Impact measurement queer encoding hidden vs visible anonymity."

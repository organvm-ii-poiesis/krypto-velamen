# World Research Brief: Community Governance and Stewardship
## Topic 19: The Cooperatively Owned World

---

## 1. Topic Scope
This brief explores models of community governance within online queer spaces. It focuses on decentralized decision-making, shared ownership, and mutual aid as alternatives to corporate-owned platforms. It investigates how users can move from being "data points" to being "stewards" of their own virtual environments.

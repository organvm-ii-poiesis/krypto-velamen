## A) Topic Definition and Scope

This brief investigates three converging fields -- Afrofuturism and Indigenous futurism, queer engagement with emerging technologies, and eco-queer theory -- as they relate to the construction of queer world-building in creative and digital projects. The scope spans the pre-history of speculative futurisms rooted in marginalized experience (Sun Ra's cosmic jazz, Samuel Delany's queer science fiction, Octavia Butler's radical kinship narratives) through the contemporary landscape where queer artists are using AI, VR, blockchain, and generative media to build counter-worlds, and where eco-queer thought is challenging the heteropatriarchal framing of environmental crisis.

For QV33R, this topic operates at the intersection of two core tensions. First: the project is explicitly anti-futurist and anti-retro, grounded in the present, the mundane, the immediate. Yet the futurisms examined here are not about chrome skylines and escape velocity. Afrofuturism, Indigenous futurism, and eco-queer speculative fiction are future-oriented *because the present is uninhabitable for those they center*. The speculation is not escapist; it is diagnostic. Sun Ra did not flee to Saturn because space was appealing; he fled because America was killing him. Octavia Butler did not write about alien symbiosis because she loved aliens; she wrote it because she saw the human species destroying itself through hierarchy. The futures these movements imagine are critiques of the present disguised as elsewhere. This is, structurally, a double-channel operation: the $SURFACE_STORY is a speculative world; the $SUBSTRATE_STORY is an indictment of the one we live in.

Second: the project insists that AI assists process, not product -- that no AI element appears in the creative identity. But the artists examined here (Jake Elwes, Jacolby Satterwhite, Emily Martinez, Nettrice Gaskins, FEWOCiOUS) are using AI, generative models, and computational media *as* creative identity. The brief does not resolve this tension but maps it, asking: when queer artists use AI to "queer the dataset" or train chatbots on LGBTQ theater scripts, what is the relationship between tool and identity? When a deepfake drag show satirizes the idea that AI could replace a human, what $SURFACE_STORY / $SUBSTRATE_STORY operation is being performed?

The eco-queer strand adds a third dimension: the recognition that the environmental crisis is not only a material emergency but a crisis of imagination, and that queer thought -- with its long practice of refusing naturalized categories -- is uniquely positioned to challenge the heteronormative assumptions embedded in mainstream environmentalism.

**Research questions guiding this brief:**

1. How do Afrofuturism and Indigenous futurism function as double-channel texts, and what can QV33R learn from their encoding strategies?
2. What is the relationship between "queer futurity" (Munoz) and Afrofuturist temporality (Nyong'o, Phillips), and how do both challenge linear time?
3. How are queer artists currently using AI, generative models, VR, and blockchain, and what new encoding/decoding dynamics do these technologies produce?
4. What are the material harms of emerging technologies (facial recognition, algorithmic bias, surveillance capitalism) on queer and trans communities, and how do artists respond to these harms?
5. How does eco-queer theory challenge the heteronormative framing of "nature" and environmental activism, and what speculative works imagine queer-ecological futures?
6. What are the material conditions (housing, health, disaster vulnerability) that connect LGBTQ communities to environmental justice?
7. How do solarpunk, Indigiqueer speculative fiction, and Black Quantum Futurism model world-building practices that QV33R could adapt?
8. Where does queer digital archiving intersect with futurist practice -- preserving pasts to enable futures?

## B) Reality vs. Artifice Decomposition

### B1. Afrofuturism: Speculating from the Hold of the Ship

**World A (Reality / Material):**

The term "Afrofuturism" was coined by white cultural critic Mark Dery in his 1993 essay "Black to the Future," published in *Flame Wars: The Discourse of Cyberculture*, a special issue of *The South Atlantic Quarterly*. Dery defined it as "speculative fiction that treats African-American themes and concerns in the context of 20th-century techno-culture."[^1] The essay took the form of interviews with three Black cultural figures: Samuel R. Delany, Greg Tate, and Tricia Rose. The uncomfortable origin -- a white critic naming a Black cultural practice -- has been noted and critiqued.[^2]

But the practice itself predates the name by decades. Sun Ra (born Herman Blount, 1914--1993) invented a cosmic mythology in which he came from Saturn, renamed himself, built an Arkestra, and performed in elaborate costumes that blurred gender norms and earthly identity. His 1974 film *Space Is the Place* literalized the premise: a Black man builds a spaceship to evacuate his people from a planet that cannot sustain them.[^3] Cultural theorist Tavia Nyong'o refers to Sun Ra's inventive practices as "acts of afro-fabulation" that "operate as a queer hack of the codes of an anti-Black world."[^4] Sun Ra's gender nonconformity and performative identity construction -- the name changes, the costumes, the claim to extraterrestrial origin -- read as proto-queer gestures even when scholars debate his sexual identity.

Samuel R. Delany (b. 1942) was openly gay and Black at a time when both identities carried severe risk. His pre-Stonewall fiction -- "Aye, and Gomorrah" (1966), *The Einstein Intersection* (1967), *Dhalgren* (1975) -- explored sexuality, language, and identity through science-fictional estrangement. He won multiple Nebula and Hugo Awards, making him one of the most decorated science fiction writers of any era.[^5] Octavia Butler (1947--2006) wrote Black female protagonists who navigated radical kinship, symbiosis, and survival under conditions of extreme inequality. Her *Xenogenesis* trilogy (1987--1989) imagined a species that reproduces through three-sex genetic mixing, and her *Kindred* (1979) sent a Black woman back in time to the antebellum South -- a speculative device that was also an indictment of the present.[^6] Both Delany and Butler created space for conversations about sexuality, identity, and power that continue to reverberate.[^7]

The second wave, termed "Afrofuturism 2.0" by scholar Reynaldo Anderson, emerged around 2005 from the nexus of social media platforms, the rejection of neoliberalism, the 2008 economic collapse, and rising authoritarianism. Anderson co-founded the Black Speculative Arts Movement (BSAM), a global community of intellectuals from the African Diaspora that defines Black speculative art as "a creative, aesthetic practice that integrates African diasporic or African metaphysics with science or technology and seeks to interpret, engage, design, or alter reality for the re-imagination of the past, the contested present, and as a catalyst for the future."[^8] Afrofuturism 2.0 is now a transnational, trans-contextual phenomenon with collectives in Brazil, the UK, France, Ghana, South Africa, Germany, and Kenya.[^9]

The material conditions of queer Black Afrofuturism are inseparable from the ongoing crises of anti-Black racism, housing instability, healthcare inequality, and state violence. Afrofuturism does not imagine futures for fun; it imagines them because the present is structured to deny them.

**World B (Artifice / Mediated):**

Janelle Monae's *Dirty Computer* (2018) is the most commercially visible synthesis of queer Afrofuturism to date. The album and its accompanying "emotion picture" feature a totalitarian state where queer people, people of color, and nonconformists are persecuted for their "dirtiness." Monae explained: "Dirty computers are individuals who refuse to assimilate... refuse to wipe away their queerness, wipe away their Blackness."[^10] The "dirty computer" metaphor performs a double-channel operation: the $SURFACE_STORY is a sci-fi narrative about androids and mind-wiping; the $SUBSTRATE_STORY is the lived experience of queer Black women under surveillance capitalism and anti-LGBTQ legislation. The formulation of the "dirty computer" -- a virtualized self characterized by mess, dirt, and inevitable obsolescence -- disrupts the human/machine divide while refusing clean, linear temporality.[^11] Rutgers University Press published a full scholarly monograph, *Janelle Monae's Queer Afrofuturism: Defying Every Label* (2022), confirming the work's academic significance.[^12]

Kara Keeling's *Queer Times, Black Futures* (2019) theorizes how speculative fictions centering Black existence provide scenarios for imagining alternative worlds.[^13] Keeling reads Sun Ra's *Space Is the Place* alongside financial speculation, arguing that Afrofuturist imagination and corporate "futures" share structural features -- both speculate on what does not yet exist -- but with radically different stakes. Tavia Nyong'o's *Afro-Fabulations: The Queer Drama of Black Life* (2018) develops the concept of "black polytemporality" that is "queer in its resistance to a teleological understanding of time."[^14] Fabulation, for Nyong'o, is not lying but a deconstructive relation between story and plot -- a strategy for Black queer bodies to perform against anti-Black erasure.

For QV33R: Afrofuturism demonstrates that the double channel can operate at civilizational scale. The $SURFACE_STORY of a speculative world (Saturn, the Matilda generation ship, the Dirty Computer emotion picture) contains a $SUBSTRATE_STORY that is a diagnosis of the present. The $MASK_TYPE is genre (science fiction, fantasy, cosmic myth). The $SIGNAL_TYPE is recognition: "I see you seeing through the fiction to the real." The $PLAUSIBLE_DENIABILITY is the genre itself -- "it's just a story about robots."

### B2. Indigenous Futurism and Indigiqueer Speculation

**World A (Reality / Material):**

Indigenous futurisms is a movement in literature, visual art, comics, video games, and other media that expresses Indigenous perspectives of the future, past, and present through science fiction and related sub-genres. Grace L. Dillon's *Walking the Clouds: An Anthology of Indigenous Science Fiction* (2012), the first anthology of its kind, organized the field into sub-genres: Native slipstream, Indigenous science, stories of apocalypse, and *biskaabiiyang* ("returning to ourselves").[^15] Dillon's anthology asserts that one role of Native science fiction is to disentangle Indigenous science from Western notions of "primitive" knowledge and myth -- a decolonizing act performed through genre.

The term "Indigiqueer" was coined by TJ Cuthand (Plains Cree, then known as Thirza Cuthand) in 2004 for the Vancouver Queer Film Festival's Indigenous/Two-Spirit program. Cuthand created it "because some LGBTQ Indigenous people don't feel as comfortable with the two-spirit title because it implies some dual gender stuff, which some people just don't feel describes their identity."[^16] The term provided an alternative to "two-spirit" that does not rely on binary gender concepts while remaining rooted in Indigenous experience.

Joshua Whitehead's *Love After the End: An Anthology of Two-Spirit and Indigiqueer Speculative Fiction* (2020) collects stories by Indigenous authors featuring Two-Spirit and queer heroes in utopian and dystopian settings. The anthology includes bio-engineered AI rats, transplanted trees in space, a Two-Spirit and queer resistance camp, virtual reality applications, motherships at sea, and "the very bending of space-time continuums queered through NDN time."[^17] The stories show collective and postcolonial responses to apocalypse while centering Two-Spirit and Indigiqueer survival.

Elizabeth LaPensee (Anishinaabe and Metis) creates video games, interactive digital media, animation, and comics that express Indigenous ways of knowing. Her game *Thunderbird Strike* (2017) is a side-scroller where players control a thunderbird defending waterways from oil pipelines -- a direct engagement with the Standing Rock protests and pipeline resistance.[^18] Her game *When Rivers Were Trails* uses interactive storytelling to teach about colonization and Indigenous land knowledge.[^19] LaPensee advocates for "sovereign games" -- games where Indigenous self-determination is respected throughout all phases of development, making the game itself a sovereign space.[^20]

**World B (Artifice / Mediated):**

The representational politics of Indigenous futurism operate differently from Afrofuturism. Where Afrofuturism emerged partly in response to the erasure of Black people from mainstream science fiction's imagined futures, Indigenous futurism responds to a double erasure: the assumption that Indigenous peoples exist only in the past (the "vanishing Indian" trope) *and* the appropriation of Indigenous aesthetics without Indigenous authorship. Indigenous futurism is future-oriented not as escape but as refusal: a refusal to be confined to the past, a refusal of the settler-colonial narrative that Indigenous peoples are dying cultures rather than living ones.

The digital dimension matters materially. InterAccess (Toronto) hosted "Skitekm Ujuawti / Ghost Road" -- a project exploring digital futurism and virtual spaces to empower Two-Spirit Indigenous queer identities through "intentional community building via online and virtual placemaking."[^21] This is not metaphorical: for systematically displaced communities, virtual space can function as territory.

For QV33R: Indigenous futurism models a temporality that QV33R's anti-futurist stance might learn from. "NDN time" is not linear progress; it is circular, layered, and relational. *Biskaabiiyang* -- returning to ourselves -- suggests that the future is accessed not by projecting forward but by recovering what colonialism interrupted. The double channel here is: $SURFACE_STORY = a speculative fiction set in the future; $SUBSTRATE_STORY = the return of knowledge and kinship systems that colonialism tried to destroy. The "future" is actually a restoration disguised as invention.

### B3. Queer Artists and Emerging Technologies: AI, VR, Blockchain

**World A (Reality / Material):**

**AI and Generative Models:** Generative AI models produce highly stereotypical representations of queer people. A 2025 study found that DALL-E 3, Midjourney, and Sora produce "a simplistic, whitewashed version of queer life," with stereotypes worst when depicting trans and non-binary identities.[^22] The Queer in AI organization, active since at least 2020, holds workshops at major machine learning conferences (NeurIPS, ICML) addressing algorithmic bias. Their 2024 ICML presentations included "Evaluating Anti-LGBTQIA+ Medical Bias in Large Language Models" and "Beyond Binary Gender: Evaluating Gender-Inclusive Machine Translation."[^23]

Facial recognition technology disproportionately harms trans and gender-nonconforming people. Studies document that facial analysis services perform "consistently worse on transgender individuals" and are "universally unable to classify non-binary genders."[^24] For trans people who experience gender dysphoria, systems embedded in everyday life that misgender them exacerbate emotional distress.[^25] A 2025 report from the Project on Government Oversight documented how surveillance technology actively aids enforcement of anti-trans legislation.[^26] The material stakes are not abstract: misgendering by an automated system at an airport, a bank, or a government office can cascade into detention, denial of services, or exposure.

Research on training data bias reveals that datasets often embed heteronormative assumptions. LGBTQ+ people are "logistically excluded from fairness work when datasets fail to include information on sexual orientation and gender identity."[^27] Sexual orientation and gender identity are traits that cannot be observed externally, making them structurally invisible in data collection practices that rely on appearance or public records.

**Blockchain and NFTs:** The Queer Museum of Digital Art (QMoDA) preserves queer art on-chain using the Tezos blockchain, with original artworks from over 40 artists.[^28] FEWOCiOUS (Victor Langlois), a transgender artist, sold "Hello, i'm Victor (FEWOCiOUS) and This Is My Life" -- five lots representing years 14--18 of his life and gender transition -- at Christie's for $2.16 million in 2021, becoming the youngest artist sold through the auction house. Demand crashed the Christie's website on opening day. Langlois has since earned approximately $50 million from his artwork.[^29] Other LGBTQ-focused NFT projects include Take Up Space (1,111 genderless changemaker NFTs on Polygon) and the 50mm Collective supporting BIPOC trans and queer artists.[^30]

**VR and Immersive Media:** The LGBTQ+ VR Museum, conceived by British creative technologist Antonia Forster, premiered at the 2022 Tribeca Film Festival and was presented at BFI Flare 2023. Visitors explore 3D scans of personal objects chosen by LGBTQ+ individuals and hear them share their stories.[^31] Forster's motivation: "if people had experienced a museum that specifically celebrated, centred and normalised queer stories, they might have acted differently" toward LGBTQ+ individuals. The Augmented Senses symposium at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute explored "Feminist Queer Augmented and Virtual Realities."[^32]

**World B (Artifice / Mediated):**

Jake Elwes' Zizi Project (2019--ongoing) is the most sophisticated artistic engagement with AI and queer identity to date. Knowing that facial recognition systems struggle to recognize Black women and transgender people, Elwes "queered the dataset" by adding 1,000 photos of drag kings and queens into a GAN's 70,000-face training set. The result: "We queer that data so it shifts all of the weights in this neural network from a space of normativity into a space of queerness and otherness. Suddenly all of the faces start to break down and you see mascara dissolve into lipstick and blue eye shadow turn into a pink wig."[^33] *Zizi & Me* is a deepfake drag double-act that satirizes AI replacing humans by using drag -- itself a performance of constructed identity -- to expose the constructedness of machine identity. The Zizi Show was the inaugural exhibition in the V&A's Photography Center digital gallery (2023--2024).[^34]

Emily Martinez and Ben Lerchin's Queer AI project (2018--ongoing) trained conversational chatbots on 50,000+ exchanges from LGBTQ theater scripts, then retrained on GPT-2, seeking to "embody the messiness of relationships, bodies, and identity."[^35] The project develops "processes for working with AI that is respectful, consensual, and pleasurable" -- importing the ethics of queer intimacy into human-machine interaction.

Jacolby Satterwhite creates immersive installations combining pop culture, dance, queer futurism, and family history through digital animation, 3D printing, and virtual reality. His work at SFMOMA imagined "a Black, queer, S&M future" through VR performance.[^36] Scholar Kia LaBeija stages digital portraits as theatrical re-imaginings of nonfictional events, presenting "desirable versions of herself so that HIV-positive viewers may see themselves as beautiful and powerful."[^37]

Nettrice Gaskins uses machine learning and algorithms to create what she calls "algorhythms" -- a play on James A. Snead's essay "Repetition as a Figure in Black Culture" -- that find polyrhythmic visual patterns in Afrofuturism and traditional African art. She uses generative AI to layer and mix these patterns, creating Afrofuturist imagery through computational collaboration.[^38] Gaskins has written about "Afrofuturism 3.0" as the intersection of generative AI with Black speculative aesthetics.[^39]

For QV33R: these artists model different relationships between queer identity and technological mediation. Elwes uses the technology's failure (facial recognition's inability to process drag) as artistic material. Martinez uses it as a mirror (training on queer texts to produce queer conversation). Satterwhite uses it as world-building (VR as queer architecture). FEWOCiOUS used it as autobiography (blockchain as permanence for a transition narrative that the physical world tried to erase). Each relationship produces a different $SURFACE_STORY / $SUBSTRATE_STORY dynamic: the surface is the technology; the substrate is the queer life it mediates, amplifies, distorts, or preserves.

### B4. Eco-Queer Theory and Environmental Justice

**World A (Reality / Material):**

LGBTQ+ communities face disproportionate environmental harm. A 2022 study in the *American Journal of Public Health* found that neighborhoods with higher proportions of same-sex couples have higher amounts of hazardous air pollutants compared to predominantly opposite-sex-couple neighborhoods, even when controlling for race/ethnicity and socioeconomic class.[^40] The mechanism: LGBTQ+ people disproportionately live in urban areas where discrimination in housing concentrates them in polluted neighborhoods. Between 20--45% of homeless youth identify as LGBTQ, two to four times the estimated percentage of all youth identifying as LGBTQ.[^41] Homelessness amplifies exposure to environmental hazards.

Climate disasters compound these vulnerabilities. A 2022 study in *Disasters* documented that LGBTQ+ communities "will have more exposure to climate change related disasters, be more susceptible to the adverse impacts of climate change and will have fewer resources to recover."[^42] FEMA's lack of legal recognition of LGBTQ families led to unequal distribution of resources following Hurricane Katrina.[^43] A 2024 study in *ScienceDirect* further documented disparate health impacts of climate-related disasters on LGBTQ+ populations.[^44] Greenpeace International's 2023 report noted increased levels of stigma, discrimination, and gender-based violence toward LGBTQ+ communities in disaster and humanitarian response.[^45]

These are material conditions, not metaphors. The eco-queer dimension of QV33R is not about abstract theory; it is about the fact that the same systems that produce homophobia and transphobia also produce environmental destruction, and that queer people are disproportionately located at the intersection of both.

**World B (Artifice / Mediated):**

Queer ecology as a theoretical field was introduced by Catriona (Cate) Mortimer-Sandilands in 1994 and developed in the landmark collection *Queer Ecologies: Sex, Nature, Politics, Desire* (2010, co-edited with Bruce Erickson). The collection argues that "discourses of nature have been used to enforce heteronormativity, to police sexuality, and to punish those deemed sexually transgressive," revealing deep commonalities between struggles against sexual oppression and struggles for environmental justice.[^46]

Timothy Morton's 2010 essay "Queer Ecology" proposed that "ecological criticism and queer theory seem incompatible, but if they met, there would be a fantastic explosion."[^47] Morton advocates ecological thought that demands "intimacies with other beings that queer theory also demands, in another key." His concept of "hyperobjects" -- phenomena like climate change that are so massively distributed in time and space as to transcend localization -- resonates with queer temporality's refusal of linearity.[^48]

Nicole Seymour's *Bad Environmentalism: Irony and Irreverence in the Ecological Age* (2018) develops the concept of "bad environmentalism" -- cultural thought that employs "dissident affects and sensibilities" including camp, frivolity, irreverence, and playfulness against the familiar affects of mainstream environmentalism (awe, guilt, reverence, earnestness).[^49] Seymour argues that this affective narrowing "elides particular kinds of queer affects, lower-class affects" and restricts non-white participation in environmental movements. The link to QV33R's $WILDE_MASK dial is direct: camp as a mode of environmental engagement is camp as encryption of a serious message inside an ironic surface.

Solarpunk -- a literary, artistic, and social movement envisioning sustainable futures interconnected with nature and community -- provides the narrative container for queer-ecological speculation. *Sunvault: Stories of Solarpunk and Eco-Speculation* (2017), the first solarpunk anthology, includes LGBTQ representation and protagonists.[^50] Solarpunk stories "function as counter-hegemonic media by intertwining issues of race, gender, sexuality, class, and colonialism with an ecological ethic."[^51] The genre provides "a space for the depiction of a future free of heterosexism, a future beyond compulsory monogamy."[^52]

Rivers Solomon's *An Unkindness of Ghosts* (2017) exemplifies queer Afrofuturist eco-fiction. Set aboard the generation ship Matilda, where society is stratified along racial lines and dark-skinned passengers are relegated to lower-deck servitude, all central characters are "both gender-variant and neurodivergent."[^53] The ship is a closed ecology -- an environmental crisis is also a social crisis, and vice versa. The novel was a finalist for the 30th Lambda Literary Awards.

For QV33R: eco-queer theory offers a structural lesson. The $SURFACE_STORY of environmental activism (save the whales, plant trees, reduce your carbon footprint) carries a $SUBSTRATE_STORY about who is imagined as the environmental subject -- typically white, straight, middle-class, able-bodied. Queer ecology exposes this substrate. Nicole Seymour's "bad environmentalism" is functionally identical to QV33R's $WILDE_MASK: camp as encryption of a genuine concern inside an ironic performance. The eco-queer move is to refuse the "natural" as a category that polices sexuality while *also* refusing to abandon the material urgency of environmental crisis. Both channels stay open.

### B5. Queer Digital Archiving: Preserving Pasts to Build Futures

**World A (Reality / Material):**

The Queer Digital History Project (QDHP), maintained by Avery Dame-Griff (author of *The Two Revolutions: A History of the Transgender Internet*, 2023), documents pre-2010 LGBTQ digital spaces.[^54] The Digital Transgender Archive (DTA), based at the College of the Holy Cross, is an international collaboration among more than fifty institutions providing an online hub for digitized and born-digital historical materials.[^55]

Early queer digital spaces on platforms like Usenet and FidoNet had "anti-memory design" -- they were not built to persist. They survive "in bits and pieces on things like shareware discs."[^56] The precarity of these archives mirrors the precarity of the communities that created them. Second Life (launched 2003) became home to dozens of LGBTQ-friendly spaces, including massive virtual Pride festivals, because "the real world can still be an unwelcoming place for LGBTQ people."[^57]

**World B (Artifice / Mediated):**

Rasheedah Phillips and Moor Mother (Camae Ayewa)'s Black Quantum Futurism (BQF) collective synthesizes quantum physics with Afrodiasporic principles of time, space, ritual, text, and sound. Their 2016 Community Futures Lab in North Philadelphia functions as "an afrofuturist community center" offering workshops, teach-ins, and anti-gentrification organizing.[^58] BQF's theoretical framework proposes that "the past and future are not cut off from the present -- both dimensions have influence over the whole of our lives."[^59] This is archival practice reconceived as temporal activism: preserving community memory not as nostalgia but as a tool for collapsing desired futures into the present.

For QV33R: the archival dimension connects directly to the project's own practice. KRYPTO-VELAMEN is itself an archive -- a corpus of theory, research, and creative fragments organized to preserve and transmit a way of reading and writing. The double channel of archiving is: $SURFACE_STORY = preservation of the past; $SUBSTRATE_STORY = the construction of futurity through the selection, arrangement, and encoding of what is preserved. Every archive is an argument about what matters. Every archive is a world-building act.

## D) Key Concepts Glossary

**1. Afrofuturism**
Speculative fiction, art, and philosophy treating African-diasporic themes through technoculture and science fiction. Coined by Mark Dery (1993); practiced by Sun Ra, Butler, Delany decades earlier. *QV33R relevance:* demonstrates how genre fiction can function as a double-channel text -- speculative surface, diagnostic substrate.

**2. Afrofuturism 2.0 / Astro-Blackness**
The second wave (post-2005), theorized by Reynaldo Anderson, characterized by transnational scope, social media platforms, and engagement with rising authoritarianism. *QV33R relevance:* models how cultural movements adapt their encoding strategies to new media environments.

**3. Afro-Fabulation**
Tavia Nyong'o's term for Black queer performative strategies that invent genealogies, mythic pasts, and utopian futures to challenge anti-Black erasure. Not storytelling or lying but "a deconstructive relation between story and plot." *QV33R relevance:* fabulation is structurally identical to the double-channel operation -- constructing a plausible narrative surface that carries a subversive substrate.

**4. Indigenous Futurisms**
Speculative creative practices expressing Indigenous perspectives of future, past, and present. Includes sub-genres: Native slipstream, Indigenous science, apocalypse narratives, and *biskaabiiyang*. *QV33R relevance:* models non-linear temporality where "the future" is actually a restoration of interrupted knowledge.

**5. Indigiqueer**
Term coined by TJ Cuthand (2004) for Indigenous LGBTQ people who do not identify with the two-spirit framework. Refuses both colonial terminology and gender-binary implications. *QV33R relevance:* a naming act that is itself a double-channel operation -- surface legibility to queer communities, substrate assertion of Indigenous specificity.

**6. Queer Futurity**
Jose Esteban Munoz's concept from *Cruising Utopia* (2009): "queerness is a futurity-bound phenomenon, a 'not yet here'" that critically engages pragmatic presentism. The future is not a temporal location but "a horizon of being." *QV33R relevance:* the theoretical basis for understanding queer world-building as directed toward what does not yet exist but can be glimpsed in present gestures.

**7. Black Quantum Futurism (BQF)**
Rasheedah Phillips and Moor Mother's framework synthesizing quantum physics with Afrodiasporic temporalities. Proposes collapsing space-time into desired futures. *QV33R relevance:* models how archival practice (preserving community memory) functions as temporal activism, not nostalgia.

**8. Queer Ecology**
Interdisciplinary field (Mortimer-Sandilands 1994; Morton 2010) challenging the use of "nature" to enforce heteronormativity. Analyzes how discourses of the "natural" police sexuality. *QV33R relevance:* exposes "nature" as a $SURFACE_STORY that carries a heteronormative $SUBSTRATE_STORY about who belongs.

**9. Bad Environmentalism**
Nicole Seymour's term for cultural thought that uses camp, irony, irreverence, and playfulness against mainstream environmentalism's earnest affect. *QV33R relevance:* functionally identical to $WILDE_MASK -- camp as encryption of genuine concern inside an ironic performance.

**10. Queering the Dataset**
Jake Elwes' artistic method of introducing drag performance imagery into AI training data, shifting neural network weights "from a space of normativity into a space of queerness." *QV33R relevance:* demonstrates how the $SUBSTRATE_STORY can be injected into technical infrastructure, not just cultural texts.

**11. Solarpunk**
Literary and social movement envisioning sustainable futures through renewable technology, cooperation, and inclusiveness. The "punk" signals countercultural, post-capitalist, sometimes decolonial politics. *QV33R relevance:* provides a genre container for queer-ecological speculation that centers justice and community rather than individual survival.

**12. Hyperobjects**
Timothy Morton's term for phenomena (climate change, styrofoam, radioactive waste) so massively distributed in time and space that they transcend localization. Characteristics: viscosity, nonlocality, non-temporality, phasing, interobjectivity. *QV33R relevance:* queerness itself may function as a hyperobject -- distributed, non-local, resistant to containment in a single body or moment.

**13. Emergent Strategy**
adrienne maree brown's organizing philosophy drawn from Octavia Butler, Grace Lee Boggs, complexity science, and the natural world. Centers pleasure, consent, and transformation at the scale of the organism rather than the institution. *QV33R relevance:* models non-hierarchical creative practice; brown's *Pleasure Activism* is "very queer and trans-inclusive" and centers people of color.

**14. Sovereign Games**
Elizabeth LaPensee's concept of video games developed with Indigenous self-determination respected throughout all phases, making the game itself a sovereign space. *QV33R relevance:* models how creative products can embody political autonomy rather than merely represent it.

**15. Dirty Computer**
Janelle Monae's metaphor for individuals who "refuse to assimilate" -- to wipe away queerness, Blackness, sexual liberation. The computer is "dirty" because it retains its history instead of being reformatted. *QV33R relevance:* the un-wipeable data is the $SUBSTRATE_STORY. Reformatting is the erasure that concealment resists.

## E) Case Study Stack

### Case Study 1: Jake Elwes' Zizi Project -- Queering the Machine

**What happened:** Beginning in 2019, British artist Jake Elwes created a series of works using generative adversarial networks (GANs) and deepfake technology centered on drag performance. He added 1,000 photos of drag kings and queens into a standard facial recognition dataset of 70,000 faces, then trained a GAN on the combined data. The resulting AI-generated faces broke down the boundaries between gendered features -- "mascara dissolve into lipstick and blue eye shadow turn into a pink wig." He created *Zizi & Me*, a deepfake drag double-act performing alongside a real drag queen, and *The Zizi Show*, an interactive AI drag cabaret.

**How it was represented:** The Zizi Show was the inaugural exhibition in the V&A Photography Center's digital gallery (2023--2024), giving it institutional validation. Press coverage framed it within the AI ethics debate ("Is AI coming for the drag queens?") while Elwes consistently redirected: "Part of my role as an artist is demystifying AI technologies." The project was covered by Artnet, the V&A, 1854 Photography, and academic journals including a 2023 article in a performance studies journal on "Digital Drag Performance and Queer Moves in Artificial Intelligence."[^60]

**What it teaches QV33R:** The double channel operates at the level of technical infrastructure, not just cultural text. When Elwes "queers the dataset," he is literally reweighting the neural network's assumptions -- injecting queerness into the system's core processing. The $SURFACE_STORY is an entertaining drag show generated by AI. The $SUBSTRATE_STORY is a demonstration that AI's "objectivity" is a construct of its training data, and that queerness can restructure what a machine sees. The $SURVEILLANCE_PRESSURE variable is inverted: instead of queer people being surveilled by facial recognition, they are reshaping the surveillance apparatus from inside. This is $BURROUGHS_CONTROL turned inside out -- not desire under surveillance but desire reprogramming the surveillance mechanism.

### Case Study 2: FEWOCiOUS at Christie's -- Trans Autobiography on the Blockchain

**What happened:** In June 2021, 18-year-old transgender artist Victor Langlois (FEWOCiOUS) sold "Hello, i'm Victor (FEWOCiOUS) and This Is My Life" at Christie's for $2.16 million. The five lots represented years 14--18 of his life -- each containing a physical painting, a video NFT, and physical/NFT doodles, drawings, and journal entries from the corresponding year of his gender transition. Demand crashed the Christie's website. Langlois subsequently earned approximately $50 million total from his artwork.

**How it was represented:** NBC News, ABC Nightline, Decrypt, and Hypebeast covered the sale. The narrative oscillated between "youngest artist at Christie's" (prodigy story, $SURFACE_STORY) and "trans teen makes art about transition" (identity story, another surface). The deeper substrate: the blockchain's permanence function. By minting his transition narrative as NFTs, Langlois made it immutable -- stored on a distributed ledger that cannot be edited or erased. In a political environment where trans existence is being legislated out of visibility, permanence *is* resistance.

**What it teaches QV33R:** The blockchain functions as an anti-erasure technology. The $SURFACE_STORY is a digital art sale at a prestige auction house. The $SUBSTRATE_STORY is the creation of an indelible record of trans existence that cannot be censored, redacted, or memory-holed. The $AFFECT_COST is the public exposure required -- selling your transition diary to strangers for the structural benefit of having it permanently recorded. This is an extreme case of the double-channel calculus: the substrate (permanence, safety from erasure) can only be accessed through a surface (publicity, visibility) that carries its own dangers.

### Case Study 3: *Love After the End* -- Indigiqueer Speculative Fiction as Collective Practice

**What happened:** In 2020, Oji-Cree Two-Spirit writer Joshua Whitehead edited an anthology of speculative fiction by Two-Spirit and Indigiqueer writers from across Turtle Island. The stories imagine futures after various apocalypses -- environmental collapse, colonial violence, technological rupture -- and center Indigenous queer survival, kinship, and love. The anthology includes bio-engineered AI, space migration, virtual reality, and resistance camps, all filtered through what reviewers called "NDN time."

**How it was represented:** Reviews praised the anthology for "brilliantly using speculative storytelling to imagine the future, teach lessons of acceptance, exclusion, and survival." Strange Horizons, the SFRA Review, and Discorder Magazine published substantive criticism. The critical discourse centered the anthology's refusal of Western apocalypse narratives: for Indigenous peoples, "the apocalypse already happened" -- colonization was the end of the world. What follows is not post-apocalyptic survival but the question of what love looks like in the aftermath.[^61]

**What it teaches QV33R:** The anthology models collective world-building as a method. It is not a single author's vision but a community's speculative negotiation, edited by a Two-Spirit writer who provides theoretical framing in the introduction. The double channel: $SURFACE_STORY = speculative fiction, entertaining stories about AI rats and space trees; $SUBSTRATE_STORY = the persistence of Indigiqueer love and kinship despite centuries of attempted erasure. The $PLAUSIBLE_DENIABILITY is genre fiction itself. The $SIGNAL_TYPE is recognition among Indigenous queer readers: "this future has us in it."

### Case Study 4: Queer Environmental Vulnerability -- Material Conditions Behind the Theory

**What happened:** Multiple peer-reviewed studies (2021--2024) documented the disproportionate environmental burden on LGBTQ+ communities. The *American Journal of Public Health* (2022) found higher hazardous air pollutants in neighborhoods with more same-sex couples. *Disasters* (2022) documented LGBTQ exclusion from emergency response. The Center for American Progress (2022) reported FEMA's discriminatory resource distribution after Hurricane Katrina.

**How it was represented:** Greenpeace International, the Sierra Club, and academic journals framed the issue within "intersectional environmentalism." The IIED (International Institute for Environment and Development) published "Queering Climate Justice" in 2023, arguing that mainstream climate movements could learn from queer organizing. However, mainstream environmental media coverage remains dominated by heteronormative subjects and concerns. The $SURFACE_STORY of climate activism (melting ice caps, polar bears) rarely includes queer people as affected populations.

**What it teaches QV33R:** The eco-queer material conditions are a lived version of the double-channel problem. The $SURFACE_STORY of LGBTQ+ life (pride parades, legal victories, media representation) obscures the $SUBSTRATE_STORY of environmental vulnerability, housing precarity, and disaster exclusion. The absence of LGBTQ people from mainstream environmental narratives is itself an encoding -- a silence that produces invisibility. For QV33R's creative practice, this suggests that Field I texts set in the present should register environmental precarity as part of the texture of queer daily life -- not as an issue to be explicitly addressed but as weather, as air quality, as the cost of the apartment you can afford because of where you're willing to live.

### Case Study 5: Black Quantum Futurism's Community Futures Lab

**What happened:** In 2016, Rasheedah Phillips and Moor Mother (Camae Ayewa) opened the Community Futures Lab in North Philadelphia -- an "afrofuturist community center" offering workshops, teach-ins, artistic practice space, and anti-gentrification organizing. The collective's theoretical framework, Black Quantum Futurism, synthesizes quantum physics with Afrodiasporic temporality, proposing that "the past and future are not cut off from the present." Phillips participated in a residency at CERN, where BQF drew parallels between "Black Diasporan temporalities" and "quantum principles." The collective exhibited at documenta fifteen (2022).

**How it was represented:** BQF operates simultaneously as theory, art, community organizing, and institutional critique. Coverage in Contemporary And, The Funambulist, Monument Lab, and documenta fifteen's catalogue treated the collective as both artistic practice and social infrastructure. The dual framing reflects BQF's method: refusing the separation between art and life, theory and practice, past and future.

**What it teaches QV33R:** BQF models the collapse of the boundary between archive and futurity. The $SURFACE_STORY is an art collective making work about time; the $SUBSTRATE_STORY is a community in North Philadelphia fighting gentrification by asserting temporal sovereignty -- the right to define their own relationship to past, present, and future. This is directly relevant to QV33R's archival practice: the project's document corpus, knowledge graph, and database are not merely storage. They are temporal instruments -- tools for collapsing desired creative futures into the present.

## F) Claims Ledger

### Claim 1: Afrofuturism functions as a double-channel text where speculative surfaces encode diagnostic substrates about racial and sexual oppression.

**(a) Claim:** Afrofuturist works by Delany, Butler, Monae, and others use genre fiction and speculative media as $SURFACE_STORY containers for $SUBSTRATE_STORY critiques of anti-Black, anti-queer material conditions.

**(b) Why it matters to QV33R:** Demonstrates that double-channel encoding can operate at the scale of genre and medium, not just individual sentences or scenes. Validates QV33R's structural model across a different cultural tradition.

**(c) Confidence level:** HIGH. Supported by extensive scholarly analysis, primary texts, and artist statements.

**(d) Sources (triangulation):**
- Kara Keeling, *Queer Times, Black Futures* (NYU Press, 2019). [NYU Press](https://nyupress.org/9780814748336/queer-times-black-futures/)

- Janelle Monae's statements on *Dirty Computer*: [Ms. Magazine analysis](https://msmagazine.com/2018/05/04/sister-outsider-sister-citizen-unpacking-afrofuturism-janelle-monaes-dirty-computer/)

**(e) What would falsify/complicate:** If Afrofuturist creators primarily describe their work as escapist or entertainment rather than diagnostic, the "encoding" reading becomes an imposed scholarly frame rather than an authorial intention. Some scholars critique the tendency to read all Black speculative work through the lens of trauma and resistance, arguing this denies Black artists the possibility of pure play. Monae's statements, however, are explicit about the diagnostic intent.

---

### Claim 2: Indigenous futurism operates through a non-linear temporality where "the future" is actually a restoration of colonially interrupted knowledge and kinship.

**(a) Claim:** Indigenous futurist works are future-oriented not as escape but as *biskaabiiyang* -- returning to Indigenous knowledge systems, kinship structures, and gender categories that colonialism tried to destroy.

**(b) Why it matters to QV33R:** Challenges QV33R's anti-futurist stance by demonstrating a futurism that is actually about the present and the past. "NDN time" collapses linear temporality in ways that might inform QV33R's own temporal practice.

**(c) Confidence level:** HIGH. Supported by Grace Dillon's theoretical framework, Whitehead's editorial practice, and LaPensee's game design philosophy.

**(d) Sources (triangulation):**

**(e) What would falsify/complicate:** Not all Indigenous futurist work is about restoration. Some is about radical invention -- imagining futures that have no precedent in any past. The *biskaabiiyang* frame may over-determine readings of work that is genuinely forward-looking. Also, the diversity of Indigenous nations means no single temporal model applies universally.

---

### Claim 3: Generative AI systems embed heteronormative bias that disproportionately harms queer and trans users, and queer artists are developing counter-practices.

**(a) Claim:** AI training datasets, facial recognition systems, and generative models systematically erase, stereotype, or misgender LGBTQ+ people, while queer artists are using the same technologies to construct alternative representations.

**(b) Why it matters to QV33R:** Emerging technologies are new $SURVEILLANCE_PRESSURE mechanisms. Understanding how they encode heteronormativity -- and how artists resist that encoding -- directly informs QV33R's analysis of concealment under technological conditions.

**(c) Confidence level:** HIGH for bias documentation; MEDIUM for the counter-practice claim (fewer systematic studies of artistic interventions).

**(d) Sources (triangulation):**
- "Un-Straightening Generative AI" (arXiv, 2025). [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.09805v1)

**(e) What would falsify/complicate:** If AI systems improve rapidly in LGBTQ representation (through inclusive training data, better evaluation frameworks), the bias claim becomes historically bounded rather than structural. If queer artistic counter-practices remain marginal gallery phenomena without broader adoption, their significance as "resistance" may be overstated. The relationship between artistic intervention and systemic change is under-documented.

---

### Claim 4: LGBTQ+ communities face disproportionate environmental harm and disaster vulnerability, creating a material basis for eco-queer theory.

**(a) Claim:** Same-sex couple neighborhoods have higher hazardous air pollutant exposure; LGBTQ youth are 2--4x more likely to be homeless; FEMA and disaster response systems discriminate against LGBTQ families.

**(b) Why it matters to QV33R:** Grounds eco-queer theory in material conditions rather than abstract philosophy. Environmental precarity is part of the texture of queer daily life that Field I texts should register.

**(c) Confidence level:** HIGH. Based on peer-reviewed epidemiological and social science studies.

**(d) Sources (triangulation):**
- *American Journal of Public Health* 112(1), 2022: "Queering Environmental Justice." [AJPH](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2021.306406)
- Goldsmith et al., "Queer and present danger," *Disasters* 46(4), 2022. [Wiley](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/disa.12509)
- Center for American Progress, "How Environmental and Climate Injustice Affects the LGBTQI+ Community" (2022). [CAP](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/how-environmental-and-climate-injustice-affects-the-lgbtqi-community/)

**(e) What would falsify/complicate:** The environmental health data relies on same-sex couple household proxies, which exclude single LGBTQ individuals, closeted individuals, and non-coupled queer people. The actual LGBTQ+ environmental burden may be higher or lower than these estimates. Also, correlation between neighborhood composition and pollution does not fully establish causation -- shared confounders (urbanization, poverty) complicate the picture. Multiple studies controlling for these factors strengthen the claim but do not eliminate ambiguity.

---

### Claim 5: Queer ecology's challenge to the "natural" as a category has direct structural parallels to QV33R's double-channel model.

**(a) Claim:** When environmental discourse uses "nature" to mean heterosexual reproduction, nuclear family, and species-appropriate behavior, it creates a $SURFACE_STORY (environmental protection) that carries a $SUBSTRATE_STORY (heteronormative social control). Queer ecology exposes this encoding.

**(b) Why it matters to QV33R:** Provides a theoretical bridge between the project's literary analysis and broader cultural critique. Camp as environmental affect (Seymour) maps directly onto $WILDE_MASK.

**(c) Confidence level:** MEDIUM-HIGH. The structural parallel is strong but is an inference from QV33R's framework, not a claim made by eco-queer theorists themselves. Requires careful attribution.

**(d) Sources (triangulation):**
- Mortimer-Sandilands and Erickson, eds., *Queer Ecologies* (Indiana University Press, 2010). [IU Press](https://iupress.org/9780253222039/queer-ecologies/)
- Timothy Morton, "Guest Column: Queer Ecology," *PMLA* 125(2), 2010. [Cambridge Core](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/pmla/article/abs/guest-column-queer-ecology/1EF919CB20FEC2B18F7B76CFCF7DC4E1)
- Nicole Seymour, *Bad Environmentalism* (University of Minnesota Press, 2018). [UMN Press](https://www.upress.umn.edu/9781517903893/bad-environmentalism/)
- Sierra Club, "What Is Queer Ecology?" [Sierra Club](https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/what-is-queer-ecology)

**(e) What would falsify/complicate:** If queer ecology's challenge to "nature" remains primarily academic and does not manifest in actual environmental policy, organizing, or artistic practice, the claim risks being a theoretical exercise without material effects. The connection to QV33R's model is an interpretive frame applied by this brief, not a connection established by the original theorists. This should be labeled as inference.

---

### Claim 6: Blockchain and VR function as counter-archival technologies for queer communities, resisting erasure through technological permanence and spatial construction.

**(a) Claim:** Projects like QMoDA (blockchain), the LGBTQ+ VR Museum, and FEWOCiOUS's NFTs use technological infrastructure to create permanent, accessible records of queer existence that resist institutional erasure.

**(b) Why it matters to QV33R:** The project is itself an archive. Understanding how other queer archival projects use technology for permanence and access informs QV33R's own infrastructure choices.

**(c) Confidence level:** MEDIUM. The projects exist and function as described, but blockchain's long-term permanence is contested (chain sustainability, energy costs, platform obsolescence), and VR's accessibility remains limited.

**(d) Sources (triangulation):**
- QMoDA website. [QMoDA](https://qmoda.art/)
- LGBTQ+ VR Museum at BFI Flare. [BFI](https://www.bfi.org.uk/news/bfi-flares-inaugural-immersive-programme-includes-worlds-first-virtual-lgbtq-museum)
- FEWOCiOUS Christie's sale. [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-life-and-style/transgender-teens-crypto-art-series-fetches-216-million-christies-rcna1324)
- Queer Digital History Project. [QDHP](https://queerdigital.com/)

**(e) What would falsify/complicate:** Blockchain permanence depends on chain viability. If the Tezos blockchain becomes unsustainable or obsolete, QMoDA's archives could be lost. The NFT market crashed significantly after 2021; FEWOCiOUS's success may not be replicable. VR museum access requires expensive hardware. These technologies may reproduce rather than resolve the access inequalities that marginalize queer communities. The "permanence" claim should be treated as aspirational rather than proven.

## G) Research Gaps and Next Queries

### What this brief does not adequately cover:

1. **Non-Anglophone queer futurisms.** This brief is heavily weighted toward US and UK examples. Queer futurist practices in Brazil (Afrofuturismo brasileiro), France (afrofuturisme francophone), South Africa, and Southeast Asia are under-represented. The geo-focus of the project names France as an anchor but this brief found minimal French-language sources.
   - *Next query:* "afrofuturisme queer francophone artistes numeriques" (French-language search); "queer futurism Brazil Afrofuturismo LGBTQ"

2. **Queer disability and technology.** The intersection of queer identity, disability, and emerging technology (assistive AI, accessible VR) is mentioned in the Queer in AI context but not developed.
   - *Next query:* "queer disability technology accessibility AI VR intersectional"

3. **Material economics of queer tech art.** Who funds queer technology art? What are the institutional dependencies (galleries, grants, tech company sponsorship)? FEWOCiOUS's success is exceptional; most queer tech artists operate under severe economic constraints.
   - *Next query:* "queer art funding technology grants digital art economics"

4. **Platform governance and queer content.** How do platform content moderation policies (algorithmic suppression of LGBTQ content, "shadow banning") function as technological $SURVEILLANCE_PRESSURE?
   - *Next query:* "LGBTQ content moderation algorithm shadow ban social media platform suppression"

5. **Eco-queer speculative fiction beyond Anglophone traditions.** Indigenous ecological knowledge systems from non-North American contexts (Maori, Aboriginal Australian, Pacific Islander, African) that intersect with queer identity.
   - *Next query:* "Indigenous ecological knowledge queer non-Western environmental futurism Pacific Aboriginal"

6. **The backlash dimension.** How are right-wing movements weaponizing "futurism" (accelerationism, ethno-futurism) against queer and racialized communities? This brief focuses on progressive futurisms but the terrain is contested.
   - *Next query:* "accelerationism ethno-futurism anti-queer technology far-right appropriation"

7. **Empirical studies of eco-queer artistic practice.** Most eco-queer sources are theoretical. Empirical documentation of artists working at the intersection of queer identity and environmental practice is thin.
   - *Next query:* "queer environmental art practice ecological installation land art LGBTQ"

8. **Longitudinal data on AI bias trends.** The bias documentation cited here is from 2022--2025. Whether AI systems are improving or worsening in LGBTQ representation over time requires longitudinal tracking.
   - *Next query:* "AI bias LGBTQ longitudinal improvement trends generative models evaluation"

## Ethical Handling: Risk Flags and Harm Prevention

This section addresses the risk flags specified in the operator variables: **privacy, outing, exploitation, stereotyping.**

### Privacy
- **DO NOT** reproduce identifying details of living individuals from queer digital communities (Second Life, VRChat, social VR) without their public consent. Many users of these spaces are closeted in their offline lives. Virtual-world usernames should not be connected to legal names.
- **DO NOT** use data from queer dating apps, private forums, or closed social media groups in research or creative work, even if technically accessible. "Publicly available" data from queer spaces is often shared with an implicit expectation of community privacy.
- **DO NOT** identify specific LGBTQ neighborhoods or communities in environmental justice analysis in ways that could enable targeting by hostile actors.

### Outing
- **DO NOT** retroactively assign queer identities to historical figures (including Sun Ra, Octavia Butler, or other artists discussed here) without clear evidence and consent. Sun Ra's gender nonconformity can be analyzed as performative practice without claiming a specific sexual identity for him.
- **DO NOT** assume that participation in queer digital spaces (VR, NFT communities, online forums) constitutes a public declaration of identity. People explore identity in digital spaces precisely because those spaces offer privacy from offline surveillance.
- **DO NOT** connect Two-Spirit, Indigiqueer, or other Indigenous identity categories to specific individuals without their explicit self-identification. TJ Cuthand, Joshua Whitehead, and others discussed here publicly self-identify; this should not be generalized.

### Exploitation
- **DO NOT** appropriate Indigenous futurist aesthetics, terminology, or practices without attribution and permission. The use of Two-Spirit, Indigiqueer, biskaabiiyang, or NDN time in creative work by non-Indigenous people requires careful engagement with Indigenous scholars and communities.
- **DO NOT** treat the economic precarity of queer artists (especially trans artists, artists of color, disabled artists) as a narrative device. FEWOCiOUS's $50M success is an outlier; most queer tech artists work without institutional support.
- **DO NOT** extract community labor from Queer in AI, BQF Community Futures Lab, or similar organizations for creative projects without reciprocal engagement and compensation.

### Stereotyping
- **DO NOT** conflate all Afrofuturism with queerness. Not all Afrofuturist work is queer; not all queer Black speculative work is Afrofuturist. The intersection is specific and should be described precisely.
- **DO NOT** reduce Indigenous futurism to a genre aesthetic (feathers + spaceships). The movement is about sovereignty, temporality, and knowledge systems, not visual style.
- **DO NOT** frame queer engagement with technology as inherently utopian or inherently dystopian. The relationship is ambivalent, contested, and context-dependent.
- **DO NOT** assume that queer ecology means "queer people care about the environment." The theoretical contribution is about destabilizing the category of "nature" as a tool of heteronormative social control, which is a philosophical and political intervention, not an identity claim.

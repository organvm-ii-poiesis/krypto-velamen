# World Research Brief: Mastodon & The Fediverse: Decentralized Safety
## Topic 28: The Federation of Safe Harbors

---

## 1. Topic Scope
This brief investigates the migration of queer communities from centralized platforms (Twitter/X) to the decentralized Fediverse (Mastodon). It focuses on "Instance-level" moderation, the "Local Timeline" as a community hearth, and the trade-offs between safety (defederation) and reach.

## 2. Reality vs Artifice Decomposition

| Subtopic | World A (Reality/Material) | World B (Artifice/Mediated) |
|----------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Governance** | Corporate terms of service and billionaire ownership. | Community-written "Instance Rules" and volunteer moderation. |
| **Visibility** | The "Algorithmic Feed" prioritizing outrage and engagement. | The "Local Timeline": a chronological stream of neighbors and friends. |
| **Safety** | Blocking individual users. | "Defederation": blocking entire servers to protect the community from systemic hate. |
| **Identity** | Verified checkmarks and "Real Name" policies. | Multiple accounts across instances (e.g., tech.lgbt, queers.social). |

## 4. Key Concepts Glossary
- **Defederation**: The act of severing connections with a hostile server. *Matters to QV33R*: A digital model for "Exile" and "Boundary Setting."
- **Local Timeline**: The public feed of a single instance. *Matters to QV33R*: Recreates the "Village" dynamic in a global network.
- **Content Warning (CW)**: A culture of "Opt-in" visibility for sensitive topics. *Matters to QV33R*: A technological "Mask" for substrate content.
- **Volunteer Burnout**: The human cost of maintaining safe spaces without corporate funding. *Matters to QV33R*: The "Affect Cost" of stewardship.

## 5. Case Studies
1. **tech.lgbt**: A highly moderated instance for queer tech workers. *Teaches QV33R*: The value of "Niche" community building.
2. **The "Hogwarts Legacy" Defederation**: A widespread Fediverse action against transphobia. *Teaches QV33R*: Collective action through decentralized consensus.
3. **Migration Tools**: Services that help users move their "Graph" from X to Mastodon. *Teaches QV33R*: The importance of "Data Portability."

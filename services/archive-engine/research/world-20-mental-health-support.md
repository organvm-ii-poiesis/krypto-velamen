## 2. Reality vs Artifice Decomposition

| Subtopic | World A (Reality/Material) | World B (Artifice/Mediated) |
|----------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Disparities** | Higher rates of depression and anxiety in LGBTQ+ youth. | Virtual "Interventions" designed to mitigate these disparities. |
| **Care** | Limited access to affirming physical healthcare. | Telehealth, mobile support apps, and peer-support networks. |
| **Safety** | Discrimination and somatic threat in physical public spaces. | Representational sanctuaries: "seeing yourself" in digital media. |
| **Outcome** | Real-world reduction in suicidality and social isolation. | The "Serious Game" as a tool for emotional regulation and resilience. |

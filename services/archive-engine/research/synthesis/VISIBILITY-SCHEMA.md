# Visibility Encoding Schema
## The Inverted Double-Channel Model (Polarity B)

---

## 1. Overview
Visibility Encoding is the practice of producing a double-channel text through exposure rather than concealment. It operates on the principle that *excess* can function as a filter as effectively as *absence*. This schema is derived from the "Lorde Insight" and the works of Reinaldo Arenas and Kathy Acker.

## 2. The 7 Inverted Variables

### $SURFACE_STORY (Visibility Mode)
**Concealment Mode**: A "safe" cover story.
**Visibility Mode**: One layer of identity (typically the publicly legible political or social identity) expressed with total directness.
**Diagnostic**: "What axis of my identity is the audience most comfortable consuming?"

### $SUBSTRATE_STORY (Visibility Mode)
**Concealment Mode**: The hidden desire/danger.
**Visibility Mode**: The *mythological or cosmological* meaning of the experience. The personal story is visible, but its place in a larger queer genealogy or spiritual framework remains the substrate.
**Diagnostic**: "What does this experience mean beyond its material facts?"

### $MASK_TYPE (Visibility Mode)
**Concealment Mode**: Formal structure providing cover.
**Visibility Mode**: **Intersectional Overload**. The "mask" is the sheer number of simultaneous identities. The audience's categorical thinking acts as the filter.
**Types**: Intersectional Camouflage, Biomythographical Frame, Terminal Transparency.

### $SIGNAL_TYPE (Visibility Mode)
**Concealment Mode**: How the substrate leaks through.
**Visibility Mode**: **The Toll of the Stage**. Signal is produced by the exhaustion, rage, or isolation of being visible on all axes simultaneously.
**Types**: Silence-to-Speech Transformation, Somatic Exhaustion, Mythological Intrusion.

### $SURVEILLANCE_PRESSURE (Visibility Mode)
**Concealment Mode**: External threat driving hiding.
**Visibility Mode**: **Hyper-Visibility**. The pressure comes from being monitored by multiple, conflicting systems (e.g., the state, the family, the community, the academy).
**Source**: The "Sister Outsider" condition -- being visible but not belonging.

### $PLAUSIBLE_DENIABILITY (Visibility Mode)
**Concealment Mode**: Strength of the cover story.
**Visibility Mode**: **Residual Opaque Depth**. Deniability is maintained not by hiding facts, but by the fact that no single audience has the cultural literacy to decode all channels.
**Calibration**: 1 (Total transparency) to 5 (Exhaustive mythological depth).

### $AFFECT_COST (Visibility Mode)
**Concealment Mode**: Tonal instability, mechanization (cost of hiding).
**Visibility Mode**: **Exhaustion and Rage** (cost of being seen). Tonal depletion, the urgency of terminal time, the labor of refusing reduction.
**Signature**: "Your silence will not protect you."

## 3. The Visibility Dials

| Dial | Texture | Author Exemplar |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| $LORDE_VOICE | Mythological, deep, resilient | Audre Lorde |
| $ARENAS_SCREAM | Raw, political, sacrificial | Reinaldo Arenas |
| $ACKER_PIRACY | Fragmented, terminal, stolen | Kathy Acker |

## 4. Craft Heuristics
1. **Don't hide; overwhelm.** Present more axes of your reality than the reader can process at once.
2. **Name the silence before breaking it.** The transition from unsaid to said is your primary signal.
3. **Use the "I" as a weapon.** In Visibility Mode, the first person is not a confession but an intrusion.
4. **The Toll is the Truth.** If the text doesn't sound exhausted by its own visibility, it isn't operating in Polarity B.

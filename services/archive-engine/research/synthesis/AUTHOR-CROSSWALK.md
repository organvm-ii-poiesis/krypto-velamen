## The Grid

### Variable 1: $SURFACE_STORY

| Author | Technique | Key Example |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Rimbaud | Visionary poetics. The default reader encounters a precocious genius experimenting with language, perception, and consciousness. Landscapes, weather, color, and mythological figures carry the surface; the emotional register reads as adolescent intensity or Promethean ambition. | "Aube" ("I embraced the summer dawn") reads as prose-poem hallucination; the pursuit of dawn is a complete visionary narrative on its own. |
| Wilde | Wit, social satire, aesthetic philosophy, comedy of manners. The surface is genuinely excellent -- complete, funny, formally accomplished -- so Victorian audiences receive entertaining plays, a Gothic novel, and clever essays without detecting a second channel. | *The Importance of Being Earnest* delivers a self-sufficient social comedy; audiences applaud the wit that describes their own blindness. |
| Burroughs | Dystopian satire, drug literature, experimental anti-narrative, science fiction. A reader can process the novels as political allegory, countercultural provocation, or formal innovation without ever registering the queer substrate. | *Naked Lunch*'s "Deposition: Testimony Concerning a Sickness" frames the entire novel as clinical evidence about addiction, sealing the surface as drug literature. |
| Forster | Edwardian social comedies, marriage plots, colonial dramas. The visible subjects are the English class system and the clash between convention and Mediterranean vitalism. Critics read him for decades as a "liberal humanist" without detecting the substrate. | *A Passage to India* operates as a parable about colonialism and the impossibility of cross-cultural friendship under empire. |
| Cavafy | Historical meditation, philosophical reflection, the ironies of power. The default reader encounters an Alexandrian Greek poet chronicling the Hellenistic and Byzantine worlds with rueful wisdom about fate, aging, and the gap between public grandeur and private reality. | "Ithaka" and "Waiting for the Barbarians" deliver wisdom literature and dramatic irony about declining empires, complete without the erotic substrate. |
| Baldwin | Confession, anguish, self-examination. The surface and substrate share the same emotional vocabulary but differ in *what* is being confessed. The prose is raw and personal, and that appearance of total candor functions as the surface. | *Giovanni's Room* reads as a novel about emotional cowardice and expatriate drift -- a man in Paris confronting his inability to love. |
| Genet | A criminal-homosexual writes about criminality and homosexuality with extreme explicitness. The naive reading concludes there is no concealment. The spectacle of transgression absorbs the reader's attention. | *Our Lady of the Flowers* presents itself as a prisoner's masturbatory fantasy about the criminal underworld of Montmartre. |
| Delany | Science fiction, genre entertainment, "paraliterary" text. The SF surface provides worlds governed by different rules, and the genre frame allows content to be processed as speculative rather than confessional. | *Dhalgren*'s 879-page experimental SF novel about a city in crisis is legible as a work in the tradition of *Ulysses* and *Gravity's Rainbow*. |
| Bishop | Nature observation, travel description, childhood memory. The default reader encounters a poet of extraordinary descriptive precision -- the exact color of water, the texture of lichen, the sound of a bus engine in fog. | "The Fish" functions as a masterful nature poem; "The Moose" as a bus-ride narrative; "One Art" as a poem about loss in general. |
| Acker | Postmodern experiment in appropriation and collage. The default reader encounters a punk-feminist literary game --- recognizing Dickens, Cervantes, Faulkner --- and reads the text as formal innovation, transgressive art, or political statement. | *Great Expectations*: the first section is titled "Plagiarism" and opens with sentences adapted from Dickens. The appropriation is announced, creating a surface of literary gamesmanship. |
| Lorde | Autobiography, memoir, feminist theory, African-diaspora poetry. The surface is already queer, already Black, already feminist --- there is no "default heteronormative reader" who can consume *Zami* without encountering queer content. The surface is one layer of identity (the publicly legible political identity). | *Zami* narrates lesbian desire directly; *Sister Outsider* explicitly theorizes the erotic and the political. The surface does not conceal --- it is complete in itself but does not exhaust the text's meaning. |
| *(TBD)* | *Wave 2 -- to be added* | |

### Variable 2: $SUBSTRATE_STORY

| Author | Technique | Key Example |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Rimbaud | Desire under constraint. Specific erotic encounters encoded as landscapes and weather, the Verlaine relationship mapped through gender inversion and fairy-tale structures, the body's pleasures routed through synesthetic catalogues. The particular grief is of desire that cannot name itself. | "Delires I" (*Une Saison en enfer*): the "Vierge folle" speaks in a female voice about a male beloved, but the referent is Verlaine speaking about Rimbaud -- gender transposition that simultaneously conceals and reveals. |
| Wilde | Desire between men, the architecture of the closet, the cost of performance, coded recognition, the erotics of secrecy, the terror of exposure, and the pleasure of getting away with it in plain sight. Activated by shared knowledge and sensitivity to patterns of concealment. | Basil Hallward's confession in *Dorian Gray* Ch. 1: "I knew that I had come face to face with some one whose mere personality was so fascinating that...it would absorb my whole nature, my whole soul, my very art itself." |
| Burroughs | Every control apparatus maps to a mechanism of anti-queer power: the Reconditioning Center is conversion therapy; the virus is pathologization; the agent-pursuit structure is the FBI file and vice squad; the algebra of need is closeted desire reduced to compulsion by prohibition. | In *Queer*, Lee's obsessive, unrequited pursuit of Allerton through Mexico City literalizes desire as an intelligence operation -- courtship as reconnaissance with constant risk of failure. |
| Forster | The marriages that fail, the male friendships that carry more charge than any heterosexual pairing, the moments where the text approaches physical intimacy between men and pulls back, the recurring "sensitive" man whose interior remains opaque. The substrate is the shape of the absence. | In *A Passage to India*, Aziz showing Fielding his dead wife's photograph: the intimacy is between the two men, routed through the image of a woman who is absent. |
| Cavafy | Desire that can only exist in memory, in the past tense, or in the bodies of the dead. Erotic encounters relocated to antiquity to make them speakable; Alexandria as site of desire and prison of repression; aging as progressive loss of erotic capital. | "Kaisarion": scholarly research becomes indistinguishable from erotic imagination. The surface is literary-historical curiosity; the substrate is creating a beloved from the archive because the living beloved cannot be named. |
| Baldwin | The surface and substrate are thematically continuous rather than formally disjunct -- they share the same confessional vocabulary but differ in what is confessed. Internalized homophobia makes genuine love lethal; the substrate carries a structural analysis of how American systems of race and sexuality produce casualties. | In *Giovanni's Room*, the "room" is the closet. Giovanni's execution is the murder of desire by shame. David narrates his own destruction of Giovanni with full awareness. |
| Genet | What is concealed is not desire but its *human scale*. The counter-cosmology makes tenderness, longing, grief invisible behind the spectacle of liturgical celebration. The reader sees the ceremony and misses the prayer. | When the narrator describes Divine's death in *Our Lady of the Flowers*, the liturgical register carries genuine grief that the explicit surface renders deniable. The tenderness beneath the obscenity is the real content. |
| Delany | A restructured ontology in which bisexuality, interracial desire, and polyamorous structures are simply how people live -- not secrets but facts. Genre is the mask, worn so conspicuously it functions as declaration. In some works the queer content is better known than the genre surface. | In *Stars in My Pocket*, the pronoun redesign makes the double-channel collapse linguistic: "she" is default and "he" marks desire, so every pronoun carries the substrate on the surface. |
| Bishop | Desire that cannot name itself, loss that cannot specify its object, exile that is geographical and emotional simultaneously. The unnamed beloved, the grief legible only as geography and domestic detail, the systematic displacement of intimate life onto animal, landscape, and object. | "Crusoe in England": the word "dear" -- the only endearment -- arrives in the sentence announcing Friday's death. The beloved is named as beloved only when it is too late. |
| Acker | A woman's anguish about abandonment, desire that cannot find a stable object, the body under patriarchal control. The pirated surface and the autobiographical substrate are braided together so tightly that the reader cannot determine which is which --- the entanglement IS the method. | *Blood and Guts in High School*: the dream maps bypass textual encryption entirely --- the unconscious speaking in visual language, delivering what the piracy apparatus cannot contain. |
| Lorde | Not hidden queerness but the *intersectional totality* --- the full complexity of simultaneous identities that no single reading can exhaust. In *Zami*, the substrate is mythological transformation: the Carriacou lineage, the Zami tradition, the Afrekete figure as both real woman and Dahomeyan goddess. | *The Black Unicorn*: Mawulisa, the androgynous deity of Dahomean Vodoun, encodes queerness within a spiritual/cultural framework legible only to readers who know the mythology. |
| *(TBD)* | *Wave 2 -- to be added* | |

### Variable 3: $MASK_TYPE

| Author | Technique | Key Example |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Rimbaud | **Voyant doctrine as alibi.** The "dereglement de tous les sens" makes every transgression legible as epistemological experiment. The mask is a reframing device that makes the same content mean differently depending on which channel the reader occupies. | "Alchimie du verbe" (*Une Saison en enfer*): "I invented the color of vowels!" Synesthesia presented as willful philosophical method absorbs all sensory excess into the program. |
| Wilde | **Aesthetic alibi + camp + paradox + the dandy persona** as interlocking masks. Art-for-art's-sake insulates content from moral prosecution. Camp makes sincerity structurally undecidable. Paradox disarms judgment by making the audience laugh before they moralize. | "There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book" (Preface to *Dorian Gray*) -- simultaneously a genuine aesthetic position and a legal defense strategy. |
| Burroughs | **Systems metaphor as alibi.** Addiction, contagion, bureaucracy, espionage -- each absorbs desire into impersonal process. The mask is not a surface but a *translation*: desire is rendered in a different language entirely. | Dr. Benway's Reconditioning Center: conversion therapy satirized as bureaucratic comedy. The reader laughs without recognizing the precise diagram of anti-queer psychiatric violence. |
| Forster | **English reticence.** The convention that emotion should be understated, nearly invisible as a mask -- experienced as "good taste" or "subtlety." Reinforced by the narrator's strategic opacity via free indirect discourse and what Forster called "the undeveloped heart." | *Howards End*: "She could not explain to him what Helen felt. She could not explain it to herself." Inability to articulate is presented as character trait rather than censorship mechanism. |
| Cavafy | **Temporal displacement as alibi.** Setting erotic encounters in ancient Alexandria makes desire culturally legitimate (the Greeks practiced pederasty) while keeping it personally deniable. Secondary masks: memory-as-temporal-frame and philosophical abstraction. | "Body, Remember..." and the "Days of..." series set desire in the speaker's own past, making it elegiac rather than confessional. The civil servant's archival habit imposed on the erotic life. |
| Baldwin | **Confession-as-misdirection.** He appears to be confessing fully; this appearance of total candor *is* the mask. Baldwin confesses race with enormous power, and that racial confession absorbs attention so completely that the sexual confession operates at lower volume. | *The Fire Next Time* confesses the church, his father, his rage, the history of his people -- but not his lovers. The racial confession is genuine; it also screens the sexual dimension. |
| Genet | **Liturgical inversion.** Systematic transvaluation: evil becomes good, degradation becomes sanctity, criminality becomes grace. The liturgical register transforms confession into ritual -- impersonal, formal, repeatable. Secondary masks: self-mythology and the criminal persona. | *Miracle of the Rose*: Harcamone's chains transform into roses as he walks to execution. Described with the gravity of a miracle narrative -- the condemned man's beauty survives destruction. |
| Delany | **Genre as compositional engine** -- not alibi. SF is an ontological tool: it produces worlds where different rules apply, and those rules are the content. Secondary masks: the paraliterary position, theoretical self-commentary, and formal difficulty as selectivity filter. | *Stars in My Pocket*'s pronoun redesign built into the language at every level. The genre (space opera) makes this plausible: in an interstellar civilization, language would evolve differently. |
| Bishop | **Descriptive precision as impersonality.** Looking so carefully that the looking becomes the subject, displacing who is looking and why. Institutionally reinforced by the New Critical establishment that praised Bishop's "eye" and "rational considering quality," collaborating in ignoring what she hid. | "The Fish": obsessive accuracy ("his brown skin hung in strips / like ancient wallpaper") makes the surface so satisfying the reader does not look through it. The critical apparatus was the mask. |
| Acker | **Appropriation itself.** If every sentence might be Dickens or Cervantes, none can be pinned to Acker. The mask is not a surface over a depth; it is a refusal to produce the distinction. Secondary masks: the punk persona as alibi, pornographic frankness as misdirection, and the theoretical register converting confession into critique. | *Great Expectations*: "Plagiarism" as title --- the announced theft means no sentence can be securely attributed to the author. Appropriation makes authorial attribution permanently undecidable. |
| Lorde | **The audience's own categorical limitation.** An anti-mask that functions as a mask. Lorde does not hide behind a persona; she allows each audience's limited perception to function as its own filter. At a Black nationalist gathering, "Black poet" masks the lesbian; at a white feminist conference, "feminist" masks the racial. Genre also serves: biomythography presents as memoir while operating as myth. | "The Master's Tools" speech (1979): delivered as the sole Black lesbian on a panel of white feminists. Blackness is the visible provocation; the queer-feminist argument enters through the structure. |
| *(TBD)* | *Wave 2 -- to be added* | |

### Variable 4: $SIGNAL_TYPE

| Author | Technique | Key Example |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Rimbaud | **Sensory surplus and referential instability.** Excessive embodiment (too much color, texture, heat), unstable pronouns refusing to fix the beloved's gender, images of penetration routed through landscape, and moments of intensity exceeding their surface justification. | "Le Dormeur du val": a dead soldier rendered with almost erotic tenderness -- the gaze inventorying this male body (mouth open, neck exposed, chest with two red holes) is unmistakably intimate. |
| Wilde | **Recognition triggers and coded vocabulary.** Signal travels through shared knowledge -- slang ("earnest," "Bunbury"), gift customs (cigarette cases), social codes, and differential reception where audiences who know detect what others cannot. | The cigarette case in *Earnest*: a comedy-of-manners prop, but Wilde's own practice of giving engraved cases to young men -- raised at trial -- shows the queer-legible signal embedded in social texture. |
| Burroughs | **Structural paranoia and system-breaking.** Signal leaks through the text's own anxiety: spatial paranoia, the pursuit structure, moments where the manual tone cracks, the routine's comedic frame barely containing confession. Cut-up produces juxtapositions that expose what deliberate composition would censor. | *The Soft Machine*: "naked boy on the bed -- Board of Health regulations require --" -- a cut-up collision between desire and institutional control that neither half could state alone. |
| Forster | **Excessive emotional charge in male friendships**, structural absence of satisfying heterosexual relationships, geographical displacement to where desire might be possible, physical contact marked as significant (handshakes, the half-kiss), and mystical/supernatural intrusion displacing the eruption of desire. | The Sacred Lake bathing scene in *A Room with a View*: the most overtly homoerotic set piece in the published fiction, contained within a heterosexual romance plot. |
| Cavafy | **Negative space, the semi-hidden phrase, and strategic bodily specificity.** Desire leaks not via surplus but via calculated absence and sudden intrusions of physical detail within restrained poems -- a detail about lips, skin, or movement carrying more charge for its rarity. Titles direct the attuned reader. | "Hidden Things": almost entirely negative space -- the speaker says from his actions and writings "only a few will be found -- and those aren't enough" to understand him. The poem maps the closet without naming it. |
| Baldwin | **Somatic intensity** (prose becomes more sensuous where desire lives), **emotional disproportionality** (reactions too intense for mere distaste), **color coding** (light/dark encoding race-as-sexuality in the all-white *Giovanni's Room*), and **music as substrate carrier** where gospel devotion carries erotic substrate. | David's descriptions of Giovanni's body carry more rhythmic charge than scenes with Hella. The differential intensity is the signal: the reader feels where desire lives by tracking where the prose comes alive. |
| Genet | **Tenderness in the wrong place** -- precision of attention (eyelashes, curve of a neck) exceeding narrative function. Shifts from third to first person where fiction cannot contain reality. **Consecration of the abject**: when something conventionally disgusting is made beautiful, the dissonance is the signal. | In *Our Lady of the Flowers*, the narrator repeatedly breaks the fictional frame to acknowledge his own presence in the cell, his own desire. Fiction cannot contain reality; reality leaks through the cracks. |
| Delany | **Structural rather than local**: world-design (the world's rules are the signal), pronoun disruption (linguistic estrangement defamiliarizing heteronormative assumptions), genre contamination (documentary reality invading fantasy), autobiographical embedding, and theoretical vocabulary within fiction creating intertextual signals. | "The Tale of Plagues and Carnivals" breaks the fourth wall to splice 1984 New York into sword-and-sorcery. The AIDS crisis crashes through the genre frame; the breach is the signal. |
| Bishop | **Overdetermined innocent details and precision exceeding its occasion.** Desire leaks through intensity of attention disproportionate to the surface object. The quality of looking betrays the emotion it was deployed to conceal. Always calibrated: enough for the initiated, invisible to the uninitiated. | "The Shampoo": washing someone's hair with tenderness exceeding the domestic occasion; "shooting stars in your black hair" carries eroticism recognizable only to those who knew Lota's dark hair streaked with gray. |
| Acker | **Corporeal excess, the undifferentiated "I," repetition compulsion, and dream maps.** The body insists on its own reality within the game of appropriation. The persistent first-person "I" across pirated texts marks autobiographical urgency. Recurring themes (abandonment, incest, the female body as property) exceed formal function. Dream maps bypass encryption entirely. | *Blood and Guts in High School*: hand-drawn dream maps --- "intricate spatial recordings" of psychosexual symbolism --- are not stolen, not fragmented, not ironic. The unconscious speaking directly. |
| Lorde | **The self-naming litany, mythological encoding, erotic charge in theoretical prose, and the body.** "Black, lesbian, mother, warrior, poet" forces audiences to confront the full intersection. Dahomeyan mythology carries queer content within a cultural framework. "Uses of the Erotic" suffuses theory with desire. The one-breasted body disrupts abstraction. | "Uses of the Erotic": the essay insists the erotic is a way of knowing --- every subsequent claim Lorde makes about knowledge carries an erotic substrate the theoretical reader may not register. |

### Variable 5: $SURVEILLANCE_PRESSURE

| Author | Technique | Key Example |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Rimbaud | Multiple overlapping but diffuse systems: maternal (Vitalie Rimbaud), literary-institutional (Parnassian patronage economy), social/legal (monitoring of "public decency" despite decriminalization), and medical/sexological (pathologization of homosexuality as "inversion"). High but diffuse -- no single statute, pervasive moral economy. | Verlaine's exclusion from the third *Parnasse contemporain* after Brussels: the literary apparatus punished visible deviance without formal prosecution. |
| Wilde | Extreme and specific: the Labouchere Amendment (1885) criminalized "gross indecency" with up to two years' hard labor. The Cleveland Street scandal demonstrated the law's reach. The threat was legal, concrete, and ultimately realized in 1895 when Wilde's own literary texts were read back as prosecution evidence. | The trial: Carson read passages from *Dorian Gray* as evidence, collapsing the gap between surface and substrate. The literary charge was weakened by character-as-mask defense; biographical charges succeeded. |
| Burroughs | Systemic and state-level: the Lavender Scare, postal censorship, obscenity prosecution, FBI surveillance, Cold War conflation of homosexuality with treason. Both legal (the Boston trial of *Naked Lunch*) and extra-legal (employment termination, social destruction). The 33-year suppression of *Queer* is primary evidence. | The Boston obscenity trial (1966): prosecution argued explicit passages could be judged in isolation; defense argued they required literary context. Explicit content drew fire while the emotional substrate passed unexamined. |
| Forster | One of the most precisely documented regimes. The Labouchere Amendment criminalized gross indecency for his entire creative life (decriminalized 1967, three years before death). The Wilde trials -- when Forster was sixteen -- proved a writer's own texts could serve as prosecution evidence. Social surveillance from class position: exposure meant prosecution and social annihilation. | Forster's 40-year relationship with Bob Buckingham, a married policeman. Forster was godfather to Buckingham's son. The queer life embedded within heterosexual family mirrors the architecture of the published novels. |
| Cavafy | Six overlapping systems: British colonial administration; Greek Orthodox Church; civil service position (Third Circle of Irrigation); the post-Wilde climate (the 1895 trials when Cavafy was 32); the tight-knit Greek diaspora where reputation was currency; the Athenian literary establishment controlling publication access. | Never published a book. Poems distributed as broadsheets to specific recipients. Erotic poems went only to trusted readers; "safe" poems reached the public. The two audiences literally received different corpuses. |
| Baldwin | The most complex, multi-layered pressure in the schema: Jim Crow racism; FBI (1,884-page dossier; Hoover: "Isn't Baldwin a well-known pervert?"); McCarthyism; the Black church's condemnation; the movement's homophobia (exclusion from the March on Washington; Cleaver's attack); the publishing industry's single-identity enforcement; internalized surveillance. | The FBI weaponized Baldwin's homosexuality against civil rights. Cleaver's 1968 *Soul on Ice* -- calling homosexuality a "sickness" -- exemplifies the movement's internal surveillance of queer members. |
| Genet | Literal and immediate -- wrote inside the institution that surveilled him. The French criminal justice system (years in prison, repeated arrests), morality/obscenity laws (clandestine first printings), psychiatric surveillance (homosexuality in police/psychiatric records), the literary establishment's gaze (Cocteau, Sartre as patrons and specimen-framers), and deeply internalized self-surveillance. | A guard burned the first manuscript of *Our Lady of the Flowers*. Not a metaphor for censorship -- a man with a match. Every word carried the urgency of potential last words. |
| Delany | Compound intersecting pressures: racial surveillance, genre gatekeeping from the white/male/heterosexual SF community, exclusion from both literary fiction and SF, the HIV/AIDS crisis, and the pornography/literature boundary as censorship mechanism. Less about criminalizing desire than about institutional gatekeeping over what counts as "literature." | *Hogg*'s 26-year publication delay demonstrates the pornography charge as censorship mechanism -- explicit content used to exclude Delany from serious literary consideration. |
| Bishop | Mid-century American homophobia (professional consequences severe; Library of Congress and Harvard positions depended on discretion), the New Critical emphasis on impersonality, the male-dominated canon categorizing women poets as minor, the literary gossip network (relationships as open secrets requiring management), and gendered surveillance of women's emotional lives. | Bishop reportedly fretted that "The Shampoo" disclosed too much. The poem -- about washing someone's hair -- was her most overtly erotic published work. The threshold of "too much" was extraordinarily low. |
| Acker | Multiple intersecting pressures: the patriarchal literary establishment (gendered gatekeeping), anti-pornography feminism (Dworkin/MacKinnon creating feminist surveillance on explicit content), copyright law (the Harold Robbins lawsuit literalizing legal surveillance on her method), the downtown punk scene (liberation + new performance expectations), the AIDS crisis, and cancer/mortality. | The Robbins plagiarism lawsuit: Acker was forced to sign an apology. The lawsuit drove her from Britain. Copyright law as direct surveillance mechanism on compositional practice. |
| Lorde | The most complex surveillance pressure in the extended corpus --- more axes simultaneously than any other author. White supremacy, heteronormativity, patriarchy, Black nationalist masculinism, white feminist exclusion, the medical establishment (prosthesis pressure), and the academy's demand for single-identity politics. No single mask protects against all systems at once. | The 1979 NYU conference: Lorde was the token Black lesbian on a panel organized around white, straight feminist thinkers. Multiple surveillance systems operating simultaneously, irreconcilably. |
| *(TBD)* | *Wave 2 -- to be added* | |

### Variable 6: $PLAUSIBLE_DENIABILITY

| Author | Technique | Key Example |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Rimbaud | Maintained through the voyant framework (all excess is epistemological), obscurity itself (undecidable texts cannot be pinned), and genre displacement (fairy tale, myth, landscape poem). Deniability was so complete that mainstream criticism operated for a century without addressing the substrate. | "H" (Illuminations): the entire poem orbits a single capital letter -- H for Hortense? hydrogen? homme? -- never decoded. The meaning lives in the refusal to name. |
| Wilde | Four interlocking strategies: camp (if everything is performed, nothing is sincere), paradox (the "true" position is always the "joke" position), the aesthetic alibi, and character distribution (no single character = the author). Deniability was tested at trial and partially held: the literary charge was weakened, though biographical charges succeeded. | Wilde at trial: "I am not concerned with the views of my characters." The character-as-mask defense partially held. The trial is the stress test of the deniability system. |
| Burroughs | Through cut-up (if mechanically produced, no sentence is intentional), extremity (content so graphic it must be satire), systems language (desire as impersonal process), and character-as-function (no interiority to decode). Inverse proof: the one text with low deniability (*Queer*) was suppressed for 33 years. | The "talking asshole" routine: as a routine, deniably comic; as a statement, the most concentrated expression of the body's refusal to be governed. The comedic frame makes content undecidable. |
| Forster | Five mechanisms: genre cover (social comedies, marriage plots, colonial dramas), reticence attributed to Englishness, the liberal humanist brand (Trilling's 1943 study never mentions "homosexual"), displacement through race and empire, and the narrator's authority (withholding attributed to artistic design, not censorship). | Trilling's 1943 study: "homosexual" never appears. The liberal humanist frame absorbed the novels into discourse about tolerance and democracy, screening out their sexual dimensions for a generation. |
| Cavafy | Historical displacement ("about an ancient Greek youth, not anyone I know"), scholarly erudition (academic frame deflects biography), controlled circulation (editorial control over who received which poems), and philosophical generalization (poems readable as universal wisdom rather than specific confession). | "The City" as existential meditation on inescapability. Surface: philosophical parable. Substrate: the closet is an internal structure that follows you. The philosophical register makes the queer reading optional. |
| Baldwin | Deliberately reduces across the career. Early: maximum (*Go Tell It on the Mountain* buries sexual substrate so deeply many readers never detect it). Middle: displacement (*Giovanni's Room* is "about" white characters in Paris). Late: minimal ("Here Be Dragons" approaches direct confession). The career trajectory is a controlled dismantling. | *Go Tell It on the Mountain*: John Grimes's conversion reads as purely religious; feelings for Elisha as spiritual brotherhood. The novel was acclaimed as a "Negro novel" with no detection of queer content. |
| Genet | Paradoxical: operates through apparent *absence* of deniability. Texts appear to conceal nothing. But the liturgical register produces deniability of *affect* -- the reader can never determine what Genet actually feels because feeling is always mediated by ceremony. Self-mythology provides factual deniability: many "autobiographical" claims are fabricated. | Sartre's *Saint Genet* reads Genet as an existentialist actor performing roles, not confessing experience. Sartre was deceived by the mechanism: the excess of celebration produced the deniability. |
| Delany | Actively minimized. Kid's bisexuality is not deniable; the pronoun system is not deniable; the AIDS content is not deniable. What Delany maintains is structural deniability through genre (SF as speculative rather than autobiographical) and through scale and difficulty (879 pages prevent extraction of any single passage as "the queer content"). | *Dhalgren*'s 879 pages and circular structure create a barrier to extraction. Queerness is distributed throughout the entire textual system -- the difficulty is the deniability. |
| Bishop | The highest in the extended corpus. Her poems can be -- and for decades were -- read with no awareness of queer content. Unlike Wilde or Burroughs, Bishop's surface does not call attention to its own doubleness. The encoding is invisible to readers not already looking. | "One Art": seventeen drafts survive. Early versions specify "the one I love," progressively abstracted to the final "you" -- maximally intimate, maximally ambiguous. Gender, name, relationship: all negative space. |
| Acker | Operates through **ontological instability** rather than concealment. If identity is fragmented and authorship is pirated, there is no stable "confessor" to hold accountable. Deniability through the abolition of the confessing subject. Any passage might be stolen; the "I" shifts gender, name, and period within paragraphs. | *Great Expectations*: "Plagiarism" as title --- a pre-emptive declaration that nothing belongs to the author. The first section of *Don Quixote*: the protagonist begins as a woman having an abortion, becomes Don Quixote, encounters versions of herself across centuries. |
| Lorde | Actively pursues **minimal** deniability --- the deliberate elimination of concealment. "Your silence will not protect you." Where deniability exists, it is residual: mythological deniability (Dahomeyan references opaque to readers unfamiliar with Vodoun) and genre deniability (essays readable as theory without registering queer specificity). These are artifacts of audience limitation, not authorial strategy. | "Uses of the Erotic" is an explicit manifesto. *Zami* names lovers. "The Transformation of Silence into Language and Action" argues that silence is self-destruction. Lorde inverts the schema's assumption. |
| *(TBD)* | *Wave 2 -- to be added* | |

### Variable 7: $AFFECT_COST

| Author | Technique | Key Example |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Rimbaud | **Tonal instability.** Intimacy only in fragments, never sustained. Tenderness undercut by violence or disgust. The self dispersed ("Je est un autre"). Endings abrupt or apocalyptic: desire that cannot arrive at its object arrives at destruction. The speaker is chronically unreliable about his own motives. | "Le Coeur vole": a heart violated -- "Mon triste coeur bave a la poupe" -- but the violation is never stated. The ellipsis is the event; the instability is the wound. |
| Wilde | **Emotional displacement upward.** Pleasure replaces pain. The comedic surface converts anguish into entertainment. Everything lighter, brighter, wittier than the substrate requires. Post-trial, when the mask is destroyed, the register inverts (*De Profundis*, *Ballad of Reading Gaol*): the contrast proves the cost. | The society comedies: audiences experience pleasure while the substrate carries terror of exposure. The pre/post-trial inversion -- from epigram to raw confession -- is the affect cost across a career. |
| Burroughs | **Systematic emotional mechanization.** Tenderness becomes infection. Longing becomes addiction. Intimacy becomes conspiracy. Love becomes need. When the translation cracks (the introduction to *Queer*, late works), the emotional content that emerges is devastating precisely because it was so long suppressed. | "The face of 'evil' is always the face of total need" (*Naked Lunch*). Surface: addiction destroys moral agency. Substrate: desire under prohibition destroys the capacity for concealment. Both channels simultaneously. |
| Forster | **The highest affect cost in the schema**, operating at multiple scales. Sentence: melancholy, connection not achieved. Plot: relationships that almost work but don't. Career: stopped writing publishable fiction at 45, lived another 46 years. An entire artistic output curtailed by concealment. | Final lines of *A Passage to India*: "Why can't we be friends now?" The horses swerve apart; earth and sky refuse what two men desire. The landscape carries the impossibility of the relationship the text has spent 300 pages not-quite-naming. |
| Cavafy | **Elegiac restraint saturated with longing.** Desire always already past; present tense almost never available. The speaker persistently alone; tone controlled to the point of emotional compression. Alexandria as entrapment: site of desire and site of surveillance. Chronic belatedness: the speaker arrives too late and knows that remembering is both possession and confirmation of loss. | "Days of 1908": three stanzas of a youth's social degradation, then the final stanza: his naked body "at the baths and on the beach" as "impeccably handsome, a miracle." Desire accessible only as elegy. |
| Baldwin | **Anguished lucidity** -- seeing exactly what concealment costs while unable to stop paying. Not instability, displacement, or mechanization but unbearable clarity: the narrator is not confused, merely paralyzed. Registered structurally: in *Just Above My Head*, the queer protagonist is dead before the novel begins. | In *Giovanni's Room*, David narrates his own destruction of Giovanni with full awareness. The reader watches a character who *knows* he is ruining his life and cannot stop. The cost is the clarity, not the confusion. |
| Genet | **Annihilation of moral distinction** as price of emotional legibility. To speak, Genet must destroy the framework in which feeling is conventionally expressed. Love becomes indistinguishable from criminality, tenderness from violence, beauty from abjection. The fusion allows speech at the cost of rendering love formally identical to its opposite. The prose is too beautiful -- the gap between beauty and degradation is the wound. | *The Thief's Journal*: moral poles are "theft, homosexuality, and betrayal." Each "vice" treated with ceremonial weight. The reader cannot isolate love from crime. Everything fused; the fusion is the cost. |
| Delany | **Normalization as erasure of anguish.** Worlds where queer desire is unremarkable, at the cost of suppressing the historical pain that made construction necessary. The affect cost is transferred to the reader (*Stars in My Pocket*: pronoun estrangement) or revealed as residual damage (*Trouble on Triton*: protagonist miserable in utopia, proving structural liberation cannot cure internalized damage). | *Dhalgren*: Kid's bisexuality costs him nothing in Bellona -- but Bellona is a ruined city. Utopian sexual freedom exists within catastrophe. The gap between the text's nonchalance and the reader's expectation is where the wound lives. |
| Bishop | **Controlled grief without specified object.** Loss never identified. Intimacy displaced onto objects, animals, landscapes. Grief always already generalized. "The enormous power of reticence" (Paz) -- the sound of a writer trained not to say the thing she most needs to say. The body nearly absent. Pervasive homelessness: geography replaces domestic life she could not openly claim. | "One Art": the villanelle's refrain grows desperate as losses escalate to "you." The final "(Write it!)" -- the parenthetical command to herself -- is the cost made audible: form demands composure while the unsayable presses harder. |
| Acker | **The inability to arrive at tenderness.** The piracy apparatus, fragmentation, and punk excess structurally prevent the text from holding a vulnerable feeling steady. Desire expressed only through extremity (violence, obsession, degradation); the mother wound as recurring substrate; the body as both liberation and prison. "The Gift of Disease" (1997) --- stripped of the apparatus by mortality --- reveals what the work sounds like without encryption. | *Blood and Guts*: desire inseparable from captivity. *Empire of the Senseless*: dedication to her tattooist --- the body as counter-text. Final essay "The Gift of Disease": the piracy stripped away, the body speaking without mediation. |
| Lorde | **The cost of visibility** --- an inversion of the entire existing model. Exhaustion from being visible on all axes simultaneously. Rage that must be constantly transformed into language and action rather than permitted to exist as feeling. Isolation: "Sister Outsider" --- simultaneously inside and outside every community. Secondary costs borne by those around the visible subject. | *A Burst of Light*: writing while dying of cancer, the urgency of a body that cannot sustain the visibility it insists on. The self-naming litany ("Black, lesbian, mother, warrior, poet") as labor of refusing reduction. |

## Cross-Cutting Observations

### Strongest Contrasts

**$PLAUSIBLE_DENIABILITY shows the widest variation across the corpus.**
At one extreme, Bishop achieves near-total deniability -- decades of
readers consumed her work without detecting queer content. At the other,
Delany actively minimizes deniability, pushing toward maximum legibility.
Genet occupies a paradoxical position where the appearance of zero
deniability (explicit content, autobiographical framing) actually produces
high deniability of *affect* through liturgical excess. This three-way
contrast -- invisible encoding (Bishop), deliberate transparency (Delany),
and confession-that-conceals (Genet) -- suggests that deniability is not
a single axis but at least two: deniability of content and deniability
of feeling.

**$MASK_TYPE divides the corpus into conventional and transgressive masks.**
Conventional masks: Forster's English reticence, Bishop's descriptive
precision, Cavafy's temporal displacement. Transgressive masks: Genet's
liturgical inversion, Burroughs's obscenity-as-counter-censorship,
Delany's genre-as-world-building. The conventional masks are more durable
but carry higher affect costs -- the writer pays in silence, smallness,
career truncation. The transgressive masks provide more expressive freedom
but are more legible as masks, which paradoxically can reduce their
effectiveness as concealment.

**$AFFECT_COST produces nine genuinely distinct signatures.**
No two authors pay the same price. Rimbaud's tonal instability, Wilde's
displacement upward, Burroughs's mechanization, Forster's career silence,
Cavafy's belatedness, Baldwin's anguished lucidity, Genet's moral
annihilation, Delany's normalization-as-erasure, and Bishop's controlled
unspecified grief -- each is formally distinct and diagnostically useful.
This is the variable where the schema is richest and where a contemporary
writer can most precisely locate their own pattern.

### Unexpected Alignments

**Bishop and Forster: the reticence cluster.**
They operate with strikingly similar encoding despite writing in different
countries, centuries, and genres. Both use precision as armor. Both deploy
English-tradition reticence as a naturalized mask. Both carry the affect
cost of "something just out of reach." Both demonstrate the career-level
cost of concealment (Forster stopped writing fiction; Bishop's output was
conspicuously small). Their alignment suggests a distinct cluster in the
schema that cuts across gender and period, defined by the strategy of
making the mask indistinguishable from the national or institutional
literary style.

**Genet and Delany: framework-builders.**
Unexpected near-neighbors on $AFFECT_COST despite occupying opposite
positions on $PLAUSIBLE_DENIABILITY. Both restructure the moral or
ontological framework rather than hiding within the existing one -- Genet
by inverting values, Delany by building alternative worlds. Both pay the
cost of making desire unremarkable within their constructed systems:
Genet's tenderness disappears behind ceremony; Delany's anguish
disappears behind normalization. The technique differs radically, but
the structural operation is identical: build a new framework so desire
does not need encoding, then discover that the framework itself introduces
new distortions.

**Cavafy and Baldwin: the confessional redirect.**
They share the confessional-redirect mask despite radically different
surfaces. Cavafy redirects through history and scholarship; Baldwin
through race and political testimony. Both create the impression that
the reader has received the poet's or essayist's real subject, when the
real subject is operating at lower volume underneath the decoy confession.
The mechanism is the same: confess one thing so powerfully that the
audience assumes they have the whole truth.

**Rimbaud and Burroughs: the systems of escape.**
Despite being in different "dial" clusters, both use formal innovation
(synesthetic overload and cut-up, respectively) as deniability machines
that produce meaning the author can disavow. Both convert desire into
impersonal process -- weather in Rimbaud, bureaucracy in Burroughs.
Both operate at maximum formal intensity to create interpretive noise
within which the signal travels undetected.

### Schema Gaps

**$SURVEILLANCE_PRESSURE as self-surveillance.**
The variable is defined as external force, but the reports consistently
identify internalized surveillance as the most durable and damaging
form -- especially in Genet (the institution has been incorporated),
Baldwin (David's self-monitoring in *Giovanni's Room*), and Delany
(*Trouble on Triton* demonstrates that removing external pressure
does not dismantle the internal censor). The schema may need a
distinction between external surveillance pressure and internalized
surveillance, which persists after the external threat is removed
and produces its own affect costs independent of the original source.

**The time axis of deniability.**
Several authors (Baldwin, Delany, Cavafy) modulate deniability across
a career, but the schema treats it as a static variable. Baldwin's
trajectory -- from maximum encryption to near-transparency -- suggests
that $PLAUSIBLE_DENIABILITY should be understood as a career-length
dial rather than a fixed setting. The *direction* of the trajectory
(increasing or decreasing deniability over time) may itself be a
diagnostic variable. Rimbaud's trajectory (moderate to zero -- silence)
is structurally opposite to Baldwin's (maximum to near-direct speech),
and both are different from Wilde's (exceeded its limit, producing
catastrophe).

**Genre as more than mask.**
Delany's report reveals that genre can function not merely as alibi
(the Burroughs model) but as an ontological engine that rebuilds the
conditions under which desire operates. The current $MASK_TYPE variable
does not fully capture the distinction between genre-as-cover (where
the genre provides plausible deniability for content that exists within
the existing social framework) and genre-as-world-building (where the
genre constructs a framework in which the content no longer requires
concealment). A future revision might split the variable or add a
sub-category for masks that *transform* reality rather than merely
concealing within it.

**Intersectionality as multiplier.**
Baldwin and Delany both face compound surveillance pressures where
race and sexuality interact. The schema currently treats
$SURVEILLANCE_PRESSURE as a list of sources, but Baldwin's and
Delany's reports suggest that intersecting pressures do not merely
add -- they *multiply*. Baldwin's homosexuality was weaponized against
the civil rights movement; Delany's Blackness was used to exclude him
from the SF community, while his queerness was used to exclude him from
literary respectability. The interaction between axes of identity
produces specific encoding strategies (Baldwin's racial-erasure-as-
sexual-encryption, Delany's intersectional double-encoding) that the
schema should account for as a distinct phenomenon rather than as a
coincidence of separate pressures.

# World Research Brief: Dollhouse for Queer Imaginaries and African VR
## Topic 14: Cultivating Safe Spaces Across Geographies

---

## 1. Topic Scope
This brief explores the 2024 VRChat project "Dollhouse for Queer Imaginaries" and broader African VR initiatives. It focuses on how digital technology is used to bridge physical/virtual communities in regions with restricted LGBTQ+ visibility, specifically in South Africa and East Africa.

## 2. Reality vs Artifice Decomposition

| Subtopic | World A (Reality/Material) | World B (Artifice/Mediated) |
|----------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Home** | Restricted visibility and displacement in physical African cities. | The "Dollhouse" as a virtual site for refiguring spaces of belonging. |
| **Geography** | Physical distance between marginalized communities in Africa. | VRChat convenings that bring together users across global geographies. |
| **Infrastructure** | Internet access challenges and the cost of VR equipment. | "BlackRhino VR" and other local initiatives building African-native content. |
| **Storytelling** | Traditional oral histories and local queer narratives. | Immersive, "disobedient" VR experiences that challenge the binary. |

## 4. Key Concepts Glossary
- **Biomythography of Space**: The act of inventing virtual spaces that carry the "myth" of a safe home. *Matters to QV33R*: Connects Lorde's genre to architecture.
- **Queer.Space**: The South African architect and artist behind the Dollhouse project. *Matters to QV33R*: A model for the "Archive Operator."
- **Disobedience**: A spirit of refusing physical/binary constraints within VR. *Matters to QV33R*: The "Polarity B" rule applied to navigation.
- **XR Ecosystem**: The network of developers, investors, and users building African VR. *Matters to QV33R*: The material base for future world-research.

## 5. Case Studies
1. **Dollhouse for Queer Imaginaries**: A virtual dollhouse used to explore the concept of "home." *Teaches QV33R*: How "artifice" (the dollhouse) can be more "real" than the physical house.
2. **BlackRhino VR**: Storytelling experiences for tourism and education. *Teaches QV33R*: The importance of "Local-native" content in avoiding Western bias.
3. **My Africa VR**: Promoting wildlife conservation through immersion. *Teaches QV33R*: How the "Landscape as Body" mechanism can be used for environmental justice (Eco-Queer).

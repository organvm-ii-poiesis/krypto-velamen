## Surface Notes
_What axis of identity or cover story is visible?_
Public political speaking. The moment after a panel at a university. The labor of being the "representative" voice.

---

## Substrate Notes
_What mythological, emotional, or hidden plot lies beneath?_
The toll of being an icon. The somatic reality of the body failing while the voice persists. The substrate is the Dahomeyan warrior spirit (mythology) inhabiting a modern, tired body.

## The Fragment
_Write here._

I’m sitting in the green room and the water tastes like plastic. 
The girl with the clipboard asked me if I needed anything else and I almost said *a different century*. 
They want the "Black Lesbian Mother Warrior Poet" but they don’t want the migraine that comes with the crown. 
My left side feels heavy today. Not just the surgery scar, but the weight of every person in that auditorium who looked at me like I was a map. 
I’m not a map. I’m the terrain. I’m the mud they have to walk through to get to the truth. 
Afrekete was here a minute ago, I swear. She was leaning against the vending machine, laughing because I’m still trying to explain the erotic to people who use spreadsheets for pleasure. 
"Your silence will not protect you," I told them. 
And now my voice is gone, and I’m just a woman in a cheap chair waiting for a car that’s ten minutes late. 
Visibility is a stage that eventually becomes a scaffold. 
I’m tired of being the evidence.

## Encoding Self-Check
1. **Polarity Check**: Visibility. Working through the excess of identity markers.
2. **The Toll**: Somatic exhaustion. The weight of the "representational" body.
3. **Signal**: The mention of Afrekete and the vending machine—the mythological intrusion into the mundane.

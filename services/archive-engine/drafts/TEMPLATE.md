## Surface Notes
_What axis of identity or cover story is visible? What genre or occasion justifies it?_

---

## Substrate Notes
_What mythological, emotional, or hidden plot lies beneath? What is the real danger?_

## Encoding Self-Check
1. **Polarity Check**: Is this working through absence (Concealment) or excess (Visibility)?
2. **The Toll**: Does the affect cost match the chosen polarity?
3. **Signal**: Where does the substrate breach the surface?
4. **Deniability**: If someone hostile asked "what is this about?" — does your answer hold?
5. **Safety**: If it feels safe to post, it doesn't belong in Field I yet.

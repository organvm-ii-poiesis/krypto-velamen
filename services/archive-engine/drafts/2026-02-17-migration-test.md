## Surface Notes
_What axis of identity or cover story is visible?_
Watching a static-filled TV screen in an empty motel room.

---

## Substrate Notes
_What mythological, emotional, or hidden plot lies beneath?_
The static is the sound of a relationship dissolving. The "Motel" is the transitional space between identity and erasure.

## The Fragment
_Write here._

The static on the motel TV is the only thing speaking to me tonight.
It sounds like your name being shredded by a paper-shredder in another room.
I keep waiting for an image to resolve—a face, a hand, a sign that the signal is still alive.
But it’s just white noise and gray light.
I’m sitting on the edge of the bed, the kind of bed that only knows how to hold people who are leaving.
I could turn it off, but then I'd have to listen to the silence of the highway.
And the highway is just another version of the static.

# Drafts — Field I: Present Waking

Text fragments for KRYPTO-VELAMEN. These are artifacts of constrained
communication — incomplete by design, operating on two channels.

## Constraints
- If it feels safe to post, it doesn't belong here yet
- Never announce queerness; foreground constraint, risk, signal, recognition
- Contemporary language, present-day medium, no futurism or glitch aesthetic
- Fragments, not finished pieces. Voice memos, not essays.

## Dial Settings (adjust per piece)
| Dial | Setting | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| $RIMBAUD_DRIFT | 0-100 | Lyric fracture, sensory displacement |
| $WILDE_MASK | 0-100 | Wit, ornament, performative surface |
| $BURROUGHS_CONTROL | 0-100 | Systems, surveillance, mechanism |

## Naming Convention
YYYY-MM-DD-{slug}.md (e.g., 2026-02-17-first-fragment.md)

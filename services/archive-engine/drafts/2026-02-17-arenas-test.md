## Surface Notes
_What axis of identity or cover story is visible?_

---

## Substrate Notes
_What mythological, emotional, or hidden plot lies beneath?_

## Encoding Self-Check
1. **Polarity Check**: Is this working through absence (Concealment) or excess (Visibility)?
2. **The Toll**: Does the affect cost match the chosen polarity?
3. **Signal**: Where does the substrate breach the surface?

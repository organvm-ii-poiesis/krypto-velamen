## Surface Notes
_What axis of identity or cover story is visible?_
Helping a friend move apartments. A mundane morning of boxes and coffee.

---

## Substrate Notes
_What mythological, emotional, or hidden plot lies beneath?_
Unrequited desire. The intimacy of seeing a beloved's belongings in the wrong light. The "chipped mug" carries the weight of a domestic life that will never happen.

---

## The Fragment
_Write here._

The sunlight in the new place is too bright. It catches the dust in a way that feels like an accusation.
"Do we really need this?" you asked, holding up that blue mug with the chip on the rim.
The one we used that morning in October when it rained for three days straight.
"Yeah," I said. "It’s a good mug."
I wrapped it in three layers of newspaper, as if it were a bomb.
As if, if it broke, the whole fiction of this 'friendship' would finally crack open.
You were looking at the view, talking about where the couch would go.
You’re already living in the next year. 
I’m still standing in that kitchen in October, watching your thumb trace the chip on the rim.
I carried the box down the stairs. It was heavy, but not for the reasons you think.

## Encoding Self-Check
1. **Polarity Check**: Concealment. Working through the absence of the word "love."
2. **The Toll**: Understatement. The "good mug" as a shield for the actual feeling.
3. **Signal**: The "three layers of newspaper" — the care for the object is disproportionate to its value.

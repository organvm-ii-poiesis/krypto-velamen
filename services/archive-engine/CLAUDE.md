## Project Overview
KRYPTO-VELAMEN (QV33R/QUEER) — a theory corpus and creative container
for queer literary technique, archival practice, and the double-channel text.
Field I: Present Waking. Organ II: POIESIS (Art).

## Core Model: The Artistic Triforce
The project is governed by a tripartite sorting system that organizes creative labor across three polarities:

1. **The Conscious (Polarity I)**: Present-focused, autobiographical, and persona-based.
   - *Goal*: To explore the self as it exists in real time.
   - *Representative*: KRYPTO-VELAMEN (Field I).
2. **The Subconscious (Polarity II)**: Present-focused, exploring the unconscious and the shadow self.
   - *Goal*: To reveal what lies beneath waking life.
   - *Representative*: CHTHON-ONEIROS (Field II).
3. **The Temporal (Polarity III)**: Future and past-focused work rooted in myth, religion, and canon.
   - *Goal*: To connect personal expression to collective narratives.
   - *Representative*: THE ATLAS / CLUSTER G.

## Dual-Polarity Text (Within Fields)
- Every piece of writing operates on two frequencies simultaneously.
- **Polarity A: Concealment Mode** (Classic Double-Channel)
  - $SURFACE_STORY: publicly legible, atmospheric, complete on its own.
  - $SUBSTRATE_STORY: queer-attuned reader detects desire, danger, recognition.
  - Rule: Never announce queerness; make the reader infer it through the costs of concealment.
- **Polarity B: Visibility Mode** (The Lorde/Arenas Inversion)
  - The double channel is produced by intersectional depth and cultural excess.
  - Signal is produced by the *toll of exposure* (exhaustion, rage, isolation).
  - Rule: Announce everything; the substrate is the mythological or cosmological meaning that exceeds the audience's capacity to process the visible.

## Three Author Dials (Concealment Mode)
- $RIMBAUD_DRIFT: desire as weather (lyric fracture, sensory overload)
- $WILDE_MASK: truth as performance (wit, ornament, paradox)
- $BURROUGHS_CONTROL: desire under surveillance (systems, paranoia, mechanism)

## Two Secondary Dials (Visibility Mode)
- $LORDE_VOICE: intersectional depth (mythology as substrate, survival technology)
- $ACKER_PIRACY: identity fragmentation (plagiarism as alibi, terminal privacy collapse)

## Six Craft Mechanisms
1. Pronoun Drift / Referential Blur
2. Negative Space as Content
3. Overdetermined Innocent Details
4. Public Mask vs Private Voice
5. Camp as Encryption
6. Surveillance as Third Entity

## Encoding Schema (7 variables)
$SURFACE_STORY, $SUBSTRATE_STORY, $MASK_TYPE, $SIGNAL_TYPE,
$SURVEILLANCE_PRESSURE, $PLAUSIBLE_DENIABILITY, $AFFECT_COST

## Project Constraints
- Anti-futurist, anti-retro: grounded, mundane, intimate, immediate
- Text is the foundational medium (Phase 1)
- No AI elements in creative identity (AI assists process, not product)
- Companion project: CHTHON-ONEIROS (Field II: Present Dreaming)
- 10 shared source documents with companion

## Research Pipeline
- 3 anchor author deep research prompts (Rimbaud, Wilde, Burroughs)
- Comparative report prompt
- QV33R World Research Operator (25 topics)
- Research output goes in research/ directory

## Directory Structure
- *.md (root): Theory corpus and source material (16 documents)
- CATALOG.md: Structured document index
- seed.yaml: Automation contract
- research/: Generated research reports (anchor authors, world research)
- drafts/: Phase 1 creative fragments (Field I text production)

## External Stores
- Knowledge Graph: MCP (106 entities, 118 relations)
- Neon DB: project snowy-moon-43700360 (13 tables)
- Companion Neon DB: project plain-wind-21545579 (CHTHON-ONEIROS)

## Writing Style for Creative Output
- Contemporary, present-day language (not glitchy or futuristic)
- Conversational, personal, direct — like texting or confessional IG
- Fragmented but not artificial
- Raw vulnerability mixed with humor, irony, self-awareness
- If it feels safe to post, it doesn't belong in Field I yet

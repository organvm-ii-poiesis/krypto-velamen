# Multi-Modal Encoding: The Sensory Veil
## Engineering the Double-Channel Across Text, Film, and Audio

---

## 1. The Core Objective
To extend the **KRYPTO-VELAMEN** encoding schema beyond text. This document defines how the "Double-Channel" text is engineered using the specific affordances of **Sonic**, **Cinematic**, and **Visual** media.

## 2. The Sonic Veil (Audio)
In audio, the veil is constructed through **Frequency** and **Rhythm**.

- **Sonic Masking**: Placing the `$SUBSTRATE_STORY` in frequency ranges (ultrasonic or infrasonic) or rhythmic "ghost notes" that require psychological attunement to detect.
- **Rhythmic Sabotage**: The "Derangement" of time. A regular beat functions as the `$SURFACE_STORY`, while the "Glitch" or "Syncopation" carries the `$AFFECT_COST`.
- **Material Synthesis**: Using sound to mimic somatic textures (latext, metal, water) to communicate the "Mutant" state without words.

## 3. The Cinematic Substrate (Film)
In film, the veil is constructed through **Time** and **Frame**.

- **Long-Take Pressure**: Using duration to bypass the viewer's intellectual defense. The "Hold" forces the subconscious to surface.
- **Frame-Edge Hiding**: Placing the `$SIGNAL_TYPE` at the periphery of the frame, requiring the viewer to "Witness" the margins.
- **Atmospheric Pressure (The Hum)**: Using room tone and lighting to signal the presence of the "Underworld" (Field II) while the characters perform the "Surface Story."

## 4. The Visual Pentimento (Visual Arts)
In static visual media, the veil is constructed through **Layering**.

- **Pentimento**: Leaving traces of an earlier, discarded image visible beneath the final surface. The "Wound" of the process is the substrate.
- **Color Coding**: Using specific palettes (e.g., ultraviolet symbols) that are only visible under certain "lighting" (cultural literacy).

## 5. The Media Trajectory (Future)
The platform follows a phased sensory expansion:
1.  **Phase 1-12**: **Textual Foundations**.
2.  **Phase 13-15**: **Multi-Modal Research** (Ingestion of existing masters).
3.  **Phase 16-20**: **Sensory Production** (Generating non-textual fragments).
4.  **Phase 21+**: **Total Immersion** (Neural and Somatic archival interfaces).

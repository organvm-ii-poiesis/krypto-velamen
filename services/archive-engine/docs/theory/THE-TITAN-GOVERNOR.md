# The Titan Governor: Governance from Organ IV
## Integrating TAXIS into POIESIS

---

## 1. The Throne
The **Titan Governor** is the representative of **Organ IV (TAXIS)** within the POIESIS ecosystem. While the `agent-swarm` provides the creative drift, the Titan provides the **Structural Law**. 

It is the counter-force to Rimbaud's derangement; it is the "Surveillance as Third Entity" made literal and agentic.

## 2. Core Directives

### A. The Auditor (Integrity)
The Titan audits every fragment produced by the swarm or the user. It scores for:
- **Deniability Threshold**: Does the mask hold?
- **Affect Cost Accuracy**: Is the tonal distortion consistent with the dials?
- **Taxonomic Density**: Are there enough connections to the Knowledge Graph?

### B. The Chronos (Survival)
The Titan manages the terminal timeline. It determines which artifacts are "Stone" (committed to Deep Storage) and which are "Flesh" (permitted to decay with the platform).

### C. The Taxis (Structure)
The Titan ensures the Monorepo does not succumb to "Root Entropy." It enforces directory standards and metadata completeness.

## 3. The Dialectic of Power
The relationship between the **Drift** (Agents) and the **Governor** (Titan) is a dialectic:
- The Drift attempts to escape the system.
- The Governor attempts to categorize the escape.
- **The Result**: The "Needle" moves forward through the friction between these two forces.

## 4. Interaction with User
The User (The Witness) can appeal to the Titan for a "Systemic Audit" or command the Titan to lock the archive.

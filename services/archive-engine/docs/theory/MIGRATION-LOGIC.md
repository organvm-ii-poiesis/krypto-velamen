# Migration Logic: The Field Flip Protocol
## Governing the Movement Between Waking (Field I) and Dreaming (Field II)

---

## 1. The Core Principle
The relationship between **KRYPTO-VELAMEN** (Field I) and **CHTHON-ONEIROS** (Field II) is governed by the **Conservation Law of Resistance**. 

> *"No work may remain in a field where it no longer resists the maker."*

Migration is not an upgrade or a reward; it is a structural necessity triggered by the exhaustion of a field's capacity to hold the material's energy.

## 2. Trigger Conditions for Migration

### I → II (The Descent)
A fragment must migrate from Field I (Present Waking) to Field II (Present Dreaming) when:
1. **The Reality Limit is Reached**: The material facts of the experience are no longer sufficient to carry the emotional charge.
2. **Fluency without Friction**: The "double-channel" has become too stable; the concealment feels like a habit rather than a survival act.
3. **Substrate Breach**: The substrate desire or danger is so intense it threatens to "melt" the surface story, requiring the symbolic protection of Field II's distortion.

### II → I (The Ascent)
Material returns from Field II to Field I when:
1. **Symbolic Overload**: The dream-distortion has become so abstract it loses its somatic anchor.
2. **Insight Crystallization**: A truth discovered in the dream-world requires the "irreversible exposure" of the waking world to be validated.
3. **The Demand for Witness**: The material refuses to remain private/symbolic and demands the accountability of lived reality.

## 3. The "Flip" Mechanics (Encoding Transformation)

When a fragment is "flipped" from Field I to Field II, its encoding schema undergoes a radical inversion:

| Variable | Field I (Waking) State | Field II (Dreaming) Transformation |
|----------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **$SURFACE_STORY** | Mundane Reality / Social Fact | Surreal Distortion / Mythic Excess |
| **$SUBSTRATE_STORY** | Hidden Desire / Danger | The "Shadow" / Primal Horror |
| **$MASK_TYPE** | Aesthetic/Genre Alibi | Archetypal/Nightmare Mask |
| **$SIGNAL_TYPE** | Sensory Surplus / Negative Space | Symbolic Leakage / Glitch |
| **$AFFECT_COST** | Understatement / Instability | Overpowering Dread / Ecstasy |
| **$DIALS** | Rimbaud/Wilde/Burroughs | Phantasm/Void/Oscillation |

---

## 4. Automation: The `--flip` Command
The Poiesis Orchestrator (`orchestrator.py`) provides a `--flip` command to suggest the transformation. This command:
1. Analyzes the Field I metadata.
2. Suggests a "Dream Variant" by mapping the $SUBSTRATE onto a new $SURFACE.
3. Randomizes a "Distortion Factor" based on the current $AFFECT_COST.

---

## 5. Metadata Provenance
Every migrated fragment must maintain a `parent_slug` and `version` history to track its movement across the coin.
- `v0.x`: Field I (Waking) Iterations.
- `v1.x`: Field II (Dreaming) Iterations.
- `v2.x`: Field III (Temporal Antagonism) Synthesis.

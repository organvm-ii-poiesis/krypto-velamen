# Field III: Temporal Antagonism
## The Work of Myth, Futurism, and Inheritance

---

## 1. The Domain
**Field III** is the domain where the archive leaves "Present Waking" (Field I) and "Present Dreaming" (Field II) to engage with **Time** as a hostile or generative force. It houses:
- **Myth**: The past rewritten to authorize the present.
- **Futurism**: The projection of queer survival into the deep future (2030-2100).
- **Deep Storage**: The preservation of the archive against the inevitable decay of the platform.

## 2. The Conservation Law in Field III
*"When a myth comforts, it is no longer doing temporal work."*
In Field III, the archive must **resist** the future. It must not just predict it; it must argue with it.

---

## 3. Deep Storage Protocol
To survive the platform (which is ephemeral), the archive must be anchored in **Deep Storage**.
- **The Seed**: A static export of the `archive-engine` corpus.
- **The Stone**: A conceptual "immutable" version (e.g., printed, etched, or IPFS-hashed).
- **The Rule**: Every 100th fragment must be committed to Deep Storage.

## 4. Cluster G: Future History
The "Future History" research cluster (Cluster G) documents the trajectory of queer life from the collapse of the "Platform Era" (2030) to the emergence of "The Mycelial Web" (2100).

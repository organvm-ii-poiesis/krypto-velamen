# AI Research Prompts for Exploring the QV33R Project’s Worlds

**Purpose:** These prompts are designed to guide a large‑language model or research assistant through deep and comprehensive investigation into the real and artificial worlds that form the context for the QV33R project. The focus is on understanding historical events, theoretical frameworks, social movements and contemporary digital spaces that inform and inspire the project. Each prompt includes citations from reliable sources to ground the research and highlight key topics.

## Historical and Socio‑Political Context

1.  **Stonewall Uprising and the Gay Rights Movement** – Research the Stonewall riots of June 1969. Explain how the series of confrontations between police and queer patrons at New York’s Stonewall Inn sparked a broader international gay‑rights movement  [britannica.com](https://www.britannica.com/event/Stonewall-riots#:~:text=Stonewall%20riots%2C%20series%20of%20violent,gay%20rights%20movement%20was%20born)  . Describe the political context (police harassment and criminalisation of homosexuality) that led to the uprising  [britannica.com](https://www.britannica.com/event/Stonewall-riots#:~:text=In%201969%20the%20solicitation%20,subject%20to%20regular%20police%20harassment)  , the community’s resistance to the raid  [britannica.com](https://www.britannica.com/event/Stonewall-riots#:~:text=transgender%20%20people%20was%20the,bars%20in%20a%20short%20period)   and how the riots catalysed the formation of activist groups and more radical queer politics  [britannica.com](https://www.britannica.com/event/Stonewall-riots#:~:text=Stonewall%20soon%20became%20a%20symbol,a%20new%2C%20nondiscriminatory%20trend%20in)  . Highlight figures such as Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera and discuss how their activism relates to the QV33R project’s exploration of collective liberation.
    
2.  **Evolution of Queer Spaces** – Investigate how queer spaces have evolved from physical bars and community centres to digital platforms. Examine how virtual reality spaces like VRChat and Horizon Worlds provide safe spaces for LGBTQIA + communities where identity can be fluid and anonymous  [lgbtqandall.com](https://www.lgbtqandall.com/the-new-safe-space-how-lgbtq-communities-are-thriving-in-virtual-reality/#:~:text=A%20Digital%20Rebellion%20Against%20the,Real%20World)  . Discuss how these digital worlds—such as “Gaytopia,” a VRChat world combining club culture with utopian design  [lgbtqandall.com](https://www.lgbtqandall.com/the-new-safe-space-how-lgbtq-communities-are-thriving-in-virtual-reality/#:~:text=A%20Club%20Where%20You%20Can,Finally%20Breathe)  —reflect and expand on earlier queer cultural spaces. Compare the sense of community and resistance found in physical venues (e.g., Stonewall) with that in virtual environments.
    
3.  **Chosen/Found Families** – Research the concept of chosen families within queer communities and why they are essential. Summarise data showing that many queer adults experience rejection from birth families and that a significant proportion of homeless youth are LGBTQ. Describe how found families provide both survival and emotional support, creating networks of unconditional care. Explore how the QV33R project might integrate the concept of chosen families into its narrative or community‑building.
    
4.  **Intersectional and Queer‑of‑Colour Critique** – Examine the “queer of colour critique,” an analytical framework that centres race, gender, sexuality and class to critique politics, history and mainstream gay‑rights movements  [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer_of_color_critique#:~:text=Queer%20of%20color%20critique%20is,workers%20and%20community%20members%20alike)  . Summarise how this framework emerged from scholars like Roderick Ferguson and builds on women‑of‑colour feminism  [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer_of_color_critique#:~:text=principle%20of%20capitalism.,analytic%20for%20political%20world%20building)  . Identify examples where queer activism intersects with movements for racial, economic or immigrant justice, and discuss how the QV33R project can incorporate intersectional perspectives.
    
5.  **Historical Queer World‑Making and Utopias** – Explore José Esteban Muñoz’s concept of queer futurity and utopian world‑making as articulated in _Cruising Utopia_. Highlight how Muñoz argues that queerness is a future‑oriented mode of being that draws inspiration from past art and performance around the Stonewall era  [blogs.lse.ac.uk](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/lsereviewofbooks/2020/11/13/book-review-cruising-utopia-the-then-and-there-of-queer-futurity-10th-anniversary-edition-by-jose-esteban-munoz/#:~:text=Jos%C3%A9%20Esteban%20Mu%C3%B1oz%E2%80%99s%20Cruising%20Utopia%3A,brighter%E2%80%99%2C%20writes%20Alex%20Hoyos%20Twomey)  . Explain how he uses historical archives to imagine hopeful futures  [blogs.lse.ac.uk](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/lsereviewofbooks/2020/11/13/book-review-cruising-utopia-the-then-and-there-of-queer-futurity-10th-anniversary-edition-by-jose-esteban-munoz/#:~:text=To%20explore%20this%2C%20Mu%C3%B1oz%20investigates,dance%20theatre%20and%20Warhol%E2%80%99s%20Factory)   and how the QV33R project might draw on these ideas to blend past and future in its worlds.

Place Stonewall within the broader context of civil‑rights and feminist movements  [britannica.com](https://www.britannica.com/event/Stonewall-riots#:~:text=The%20riots%20%20outside%20the,riots%20became%20a%20galvanizing%20force)  . Present findings as a report with clear headings, concise paragraphs, and bullet lists for key events. Include proper citations for every substantive fact.
    
2.  **From Bars to VR: Evolution of Queer Spaces (Physical & Digital)**  
    _Task_: Explore how queer social spaces have evolved from mid‑20th‑century bars and clubs to today’s virtual realities. First, summarise the role of physical venues like the Stonewall Inn and ballrooms as havens from police harassment. Then investigate how LGBTQIA + communities use digital platforms such as VRChat and Horizon Worlds to create new “safe spaces.” Highlight prominent queer‑run worlds (e.g., Gaytopia) and the immersive VR project “Dollhouse for Queer Imaginaries,” noting how these spaces allow fluid identity expression and cross‑continental community building  [lgbtqandall.com](https://www.lgbtqandall.com/the-new-safe-space-how-lgbtq-communities-are-thriving-in-virtual-reality/#:~:text=A%20Digital%20Rebellion%20Against%20the,Real%20World)    [voicesofvr.com](https://voicesofvr.com/1511-cultivating-virtual-lgbtqia-safe-spaces-in-vrchat-with-dollhouse-for-queer-imaginaries/#:~:text=,convenings%20of%20people%20across%20geographies)  . Discuss how digital Pride festivals and online queer events flourished during the COVID‑19 pandemic, and examine the pros (e.g., accessibility, experimentation) and cons (e.g., moderation challenges) of virtual spaces  [lgbtqandall.com](https://www.lgbtqandall.com/the-new-safe-space-how-lgbtq-communities-are-thriving-in-virtual-reality/#:~:text=The%20Evolution%20of%20Queer%20Spaces)  . Collect information from official platforms, credible interviews and academic analyses, and provide citations.
    
3.  **Chosen Families, Mental Health and Measuring Impact**  
    _Task_: Research the concept of found/chosen family in queer communities, focusing on why these networks are vital. Present data on family rejection (e.g., statistics showing high rates of homelessness among LGBTQ youth) and explain how chosen families offer both survival and emotional support. Examine mental‑health research on affirming online communities, noting studies that link safe digital spaces to reduced loneliness and anxiety  [lgbtqandall.com](https://www.lgbtqandall.com/the-new-safe-space-how-lgbtq-communities-are-thriving-in-virtual-reality/#:~:text=The%20Technology%20of%20Freedom)  . Propose methodologies for assessing the impact of digital queer projects (surveys, interviews, participatory design). Summarise best practices for gathering feedback ethically and ensuring participant privacy. Use academic articles, reports from LGBTQ advocacy groups and peer‑reviewed studies, citing all sources.
    
4.  **Intersectional and Global Queer Activism**  
    _Task_: Provide an overview of intersectional queer activism. Define the “queer of colour critique,” which centres race, gender, sexuality and class in its analysis  [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer_of_color_critique#:~:text=Queer%20of%20color%20critique%20is,workers%20and%20community%20members%20alike)  , and discuss its origins in scholarship by Roderick A. Ferguson and others. Identify activist movements that integrate LGBTQ rights with racial justice, immigration reform and economic equality. Then survey recent queer movements worldwide (e.g., trans rights campaigns in Europe and North America, decriminalisation efforts in Africa and Asia, resistance to anti‑LGBTQ legislation). Highlight successes and setbacks in the 2020s and evaluate how intersectionality shapes strategies across different regions. Rely on academic papers, human‑rights organisation reports and reputable news sources; cite all information.
    
5.  **Creative Frameworks: Performance, Theory and World‑Making**  
    _Task_: Investigate artistic and theoretical frameworks that inform queer world‑building. Begin with José Esteban Muñoz’s _Cruising Utopia_ and his argument that queerness is a future‑oriented, utopian mode drawn from past art and performance  [blogs.lse.ac.uk](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/lsereviewofbooks/2020/11/13/book-review-cruising-utopia-the-then-and-there-of-queer-futurity-10th-anniversary-edition-by-jose-esteban-munoz/#:~:text=Jos%C3%A9%20Esteban%20Mu%C3%B1oz%E2%80%99s%20Cruising%20Utopia%3A,brighter%E2%80%99%2C%20writes%20Alex%20Hoyos%20Twomey)    [blogs.lse.ac.uk](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/lsereviewofbooks/2020/11/13/book-review-cruising-utopia-the-then-and-there-of-queer-futurity-10th-anniversary-edition-by-jose-esteban-munoz/#:~:text=To%20explore%20this%2C%20Mu%C3%B1oz%20investigates,dance%20theatre%20and%20Warhol%E2%80%99s%20Factory)  . Summarise Judith Butler’s concept of gender performativity and its implications for identity construction. Trace the history of queer performance art (drag, ballroom, cabaret) and highlight artists who blur reality and fiction. Review speculative literature and media (e.g., works by Samuel Delany, Octavia Butler, NK Jemisin) that envision alternative queer societies and relationships. Organise findings into thematic sections, each with supporting citations from academic texts and interviews with artists.
    
6.  **Cultural Histories & Expressions**  
    _Task_: Explore diverse cultural histories and expressions of queer identity. Examine pre‑colonial and non‑Western gender‑diverse roles: Two‑Spirit identities in Indigenous North American cultures, hijras in South Asia, and bissu in Indonesia  [hrc.org](https://www.hrc.org/news/two-spirit-and-lgbtq-idenitites-today-and-centuries-ago#:~:text=Two%20Spirit%20and%20LGBTQ%2B%20Identities%3A,third%20genders%20in%20their%20communities)  . Investigate how colonialism altered these traditions. Study coded languages and symbols (Polari, ballroom slang, hanky codes) that allowed queer communities to communicate discreetly. Assess the significance of music in queer culture, from disco and house to contemporary queer pop and experimental sound art. Use ethnographic studies, historical records and musicology research to provide a global overview. Present the information with clear subheadings and cite sources.
    
7.  **Futurisms and Emerging Innovations**  
    _Task_: Research Afrofuturism and Indigenous futurism as movements that imagine futures rooted in Black and Indigenous experiences, often incorporating queer themes. Analyze how these frameworks can influence queer world‑building in digital projects. Next, examine emerging technologies—AI, AR/VR, generative art, blockchain—that queer artists are using to push creative boundaries. Discuss the environmental dimension by exploring eco‑queer theory and how queer futurist works envision sustainable, climate‑conscious societies. Gather information from scholarly articles, artist interviews and technology publications, and provide citations.
    
8.  **Ethics, Safety, Governance and Well‑Being in Queer Digital Worlds**  
    _Task_: Develop guidelines for creating ethical and inclusive queer virtual environments. Investigate debates around representation and appropriation: who gets to tell queer stories, how commodification affects marginalized communities, and how to balance visibility with safety. Review moderation strategies and safety tools used in social VR platforms to combat harassment. Examine models of community governance (e.g., cooperative worlds, shared ownership, mutual aid) that empower participants. Address mental‑health considerations by summarising research on the psychological impact of digital communities and outlining how to provide support resources. Compile best practices from scholarly sources, platform policies and activist groups, with citations.
    
9.  **Connecting Virtual Worlds with Real‑World Activism**  
    _Task_: Analyze how digital art projects bridge virtual experiences and real‑world activism. Identify examples where virtual performances or installations raised awareness or funds for queer causes. Explore how participatory design and storytelling in VR can inspire offline engagement, such as policy advocacy or community organising. Suggest strategies for the QV33R project to align its artificial worlds with tangible social‑justice initiatives (e.g., donation links, educational resources, partnerships with nonprofits). Use case studies, interviews and nonprofit reports, citing all sources.
    

These prompts are designed to guide research assistants in producing thorough, well‑structured reports that draw from up‑to‑date, authoritative sources and integrate the historical, cultural and technological dimensions of the QV33R project.

## Q: 
Do these follow best prompting practices?!

## A: 
According to a document from 2025-12-30, your current “25 paths” read as a solid research topic map, but they do not yet consistently follow best prompting practices for reliably producing deep, repeatable, citation-grounded research outputs.

1.  What your 25-path set already does well  
    It establishes scope. It is thematically coherent. It separates domains (history, culture/theory, digital worlds, ethics, contemporary developments). That is the correct upstream move for a project like QV33R that needs to stay rooted in contemporary lived mediums and language rather than a “techy/glitch” frame.
    
    ChatGPT-Queer Project Growth St…
    
2.  Where it falls short of “best practices”  
    The current items are mostly “research instructions” rather than “execution prompts.” Best-practice prompting guidance across OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google consistently emphasizes specificity, explicit output format, clear constraints, and iterative evaluation loops.   [OpenAI Help Center](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6654000-best-practices-for-prompt-engineering-with-the-openai-api?utm_source=chatgpt.com)    
    Your 25 items usually omit: a defined researcher role, a required evidence standard (what counts as a strong source), a deliverable format (tables, timelines, claim ledgers), a method (how to search, how to triangulate), an explicit “reality vs artifice” decomposition, and acceptance criteria (what “done” means).
    
3.  The practical verdict  
    If you run most of the 25 as-is, you will often get good prose, but you will not reliably get: traceable citations, consistent structure across topics, comparable outputs topic-to-topic, or controlled depth. That is exactly what “best prompting practices” are meant to stabilize.   [OpenAI Help Center](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6654000-best-practices-for-prompt-engineering-with-the-openai-api?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
    
4.  A best-practice prompt that can drive any of the 25 paths (and also combines them cleanly)  
    Use this as your standard “QV33R Deep Research Operator.” You set variables once, then swap only $TOPIC_ID and $TOPIC_NAME (or pass multiple topics at once to combine them logically). It is written to force the “reality & artifice” dual-lens you requested, while producing outputs you can compare across all 25.

You are a senior research analyst and cultural historian specializing in queer studies, media ecology, and digital subcultures.
Your task is to produce a citation-grounded research brief for $PROJECT_ID, using the topic(s) in $TOPIC_SET.

Non-negotiable framing: analyze TWO coupled worlds for every claim.
World A (Reality / Material): institutions, laws, events, places, economies, health/violence, lived practice, community infrastructure.
World B (Artifice / Mediated): representation, platform mechanics, aesthetics, narrative conventions, audience participation, performance, archives, misinformation dynamics.

Method requirements:
1) Begin by listing the 6–10 most important research questions you will answer for this topic set.
2) Build a “Claims Ledger”: for each major claim, provide (a) the claim, (b) why it matters to QV33R, (c) confidence level, (d) at least 2 independent sources (triangulation), (e) what would falsify or complicate the claim.
3) Maintain a clear boundary between evidence and interpretation. If you infer, label it as inference.
4) Use at least $SOURCE_MIN sources total, meeting $SOURCE_BALANCE.
5) Include a short section on “Ethical Handling” keyed to $RISK_FLAGS, stating what NOT to do (harm prevention).

Deliverables (in this exact order):
A) Topic definition and scope, including $TIME_WINDOW_PAST and $TIME_WINDOW_PRESENT, plus $GEO_FOCUS.
B) Reality vs Artifice decomposition: a paired outline where each subtopic has both a World A and World B entry.
C) Timeline: 12–20 dated entries (or era-bounded entries) that matter to QV33R.
D) Key concepts glossary: 12–20 terms with concise definitions and why each term matters to QV33R.
E) Case study stack: 3–5 mini case studies, each with “what happened,” “how it was represented,” “what it teaches QV33R.”
F) Claims Ledger (table-like formatting).
G) Research gaps and next queries: what you still need, and exactly what to search next.

Output format constraints:
If $OUTPUT_FORMAT=="JSON", output valid JSON with keys: scope, questions, paired_outline, timeline, glossary, case_studies, claims_ledger, ethical_handling, gaps_next_queries, sources.
If $OUTPUT_FORMAT!="JSON", use clear section headers with consistent formatting and include citations per $CITATION_STYLE.

Style constraints:
Honor $VOICE_CONSTRAINT. Keep language contemporary and medium-native. No “futuristic glitch” framing unless the topic explicitly requires it.

Stop condition:
If you cannot reach the source minimum or cannot triangulate a major claim, say so explicitly and downgrade confidence; do not fabricate.

Why this qualifies as “best practices”  
It operationalizes clarity and specificity, forces structure and delimiters, demands explicit output formats, and makes iteration and verification first-class, which is exactly what the major vendor guides recommend.

5.  How to use it to “combine if logical” across the 25  
    Set $TOPIC_SET to a cluster like “1,2,3” for Stonewall plus evolution of queer spaces plus chosen families, and you will get one unified brief with a single timeline, shared glossary, and a merged claims ledger, which prevents duplicated research and keeps your QV33R worldview consistent across prompts.
    

If you paste your current 25 items here (or tell me which IDs you want clustered), I will convert each into a ready-to-run instantiation of the operator prompt above using $TOPIC_SET presets, while keeping the outputs comparable across all 25.

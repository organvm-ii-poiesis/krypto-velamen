A theory corpus and creative container for queer literary technique, archival practice, and the double-channel text. **KRYPTO-VELAMEN** is a living cultural instrument that documents lived interiority in real time, refusing narrative closure, technological fetishism, or moral framing.

## 🏛 Etymology and Ontological Name

The name fuses a Greek prefix with a Latin noun:

- **κρυπτο- (krypto-)** — hidden, concealed, secret. Not deception but structural concealment: something present but not immediately legible.
- **velamen** — veil, covering, membrane. The covering that both hides and reveals sacred content.

Together, they name the compositional engine of writing that operates on two channels at once: what a default reader consumes on the surface, and what a queer-attuned reader detects as the real emotional plot beneath.

## ⚙️ Core Model: Dual-Polarity Text

Every piece of writing in this archive operates on two frequencies simultaneously. As of Phase 5, the model supports two distinct polarities:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[KRYPTO-VELAMEN Archive] --> B(Polarity A: Concealment)
    A --> C(Polarity B: Visibility)
    
    B --> B1[Surface: Atmosphere/Story]
    B --> B2[Substrate: Desire/Danger]
    B --> B3[Rule: Never Announce]
    
    C --> C1[Surface: Political/Social Identity]
    C --> C2[Substrate: Mythological/Cosmological Depth]
    C --> C3[Rule: Announce Everything]
    
    style B fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

### Polarity A: Concealment Mode (Classic)
- **$SURFACE_STORY**: Publicly legible, complete on its own.
- **$SUBSTRATE_STORY**: Queer-attuned reader detects hidden desire.
- **Rule**: Make the reader infer queerness through the costs of concealment.

### Polarity B: Visibility Mode (Inversion)
- **Signal**: Produced by the *toll of exposure* (exhaustion, rage, isolation).
- **Substrate**: The mythological meaning that exceeds the audience's capacity to process the visible.
- **Rule**: The "Stage" is the site of the wound.

## 🎛 Author Dials & Craft Mechanisms

We map technique through foundational influences, treated as operational parameters:

### Author Dials
- **$RIMBAUD_DRIFT**: Desire as weather (lyric fracture, sensory overload).
- **$WILDE_MASK**: Truth as performance (wit, ornament, paradox).
- **$BURROUGHS_CONTROL**: Desire under surveillance (systems, paranoia, mechanism).
- **$LORDE_VOICE**: Intersectional depth (mythology, survival technology).
- **$ACKER_PIRACY**: Identity fragmentation (piracy, terminal privacy collapse).

### Six Core Craft Mechanisms
1. **Pronoun Drift**: Unstable reference; refusal to pin down the beloved.
2. **Negative Space**: Ellipsis, hard cuts; the absence is the loudest data.
3. **Overdetermined Details**: Mundane objects carrying disproportionate emotional weight.
4. **Public Mask vs Private Voice**: Friction between social persona and interiority.
5. **Camp as Encryption**: Style as cipher; defensive encoding.
6. **Surveillance as Third Entity**: The internalized watcher shaping the rhythm of the sentence.

## 📂 Research Pipeline

The project maintains a systematic research pipeline organized into five clusters:

- **Cluster A (Lyric Displacement)**: Rimbaud, Genet, Cavafy, Bishop.
- **Cluster B (Style as Alibi)**: Wilde, Forster, Auden.
- **Cluster C (Control Systems)**: Burroughs, Delany, Acker.
- **Cluster D (Modernity Bridges)**: Baldwin, Woolf, Williams.
- **Cluster E (Visibility Mode)**: Lorde, Arenas, Guibert.

Full reports are located in [`research/`](research/).

## 🛠 Unified Poiesis Workspace

We provide a suite of Python tools to assist in the production and validation of dual-channel texts.

### `tools/orchestrator.py`
The central command center for the repository.
```bash
# Display project status dashboard
python tools/orchestrator.py dashboard

# Scaffold a new fragment using a preset
python tools/orchestrator.py scaffold --slug "my-piece" --preset confessional-whisper

# Validate a fragment's integrity
python tools/orchestrator.py validate drafts/2026-02-17-my-piece.md

# Query the Mechanism Atlas
python tools/orchestrator.py lookup --mechanism "negative_space"
```

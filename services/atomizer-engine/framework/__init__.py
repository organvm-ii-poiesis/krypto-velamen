LingFrame - Computational Rhetoric Platform

A framework for computational rhetorical analysis that transforms text into
hierarchical structures and applies multi-dimensional analysis pipelines
to reveal patterns, argumentative structure, and compositional dynamics.

Core Components:
- core/: Atomization engine, ontology, naming system
- analysis/: Heuristic analysis modules (evaluation, semantic, etc.)
- generation/: Revision suggestion generation
- visualization/: Interactive visualization adapters
- output/: Report formatters
- domains/: Domain-specific profiles

NOTE: This framework performs heuristic analysis using pattern matching.
Scores are indicators for human interpretation, not validated measurements.
See docs/limitations.md for methodology and limitations.

## Concept Index

An alphabetical index of core concepts, encoding variables, and craft mechanisms referenced across the corpus. Document filenames indicate where each concept is defined or substantially discussed.

- **Affect Cost** (`$AFFECT_COST`) -- Encoding variable measuring the emotional toll of concealment on the writing subject. See: QUEER-Queer-Aesthetic-of-Hiding.md, QUEER-AI-prompts-for-QV33R.md

- **Anti-Futurism** -- Rejection of futurism, transcendence narratives, and technological fetishism. The project is grounded, mundane, ugly, intimate, and immediate. See: QUEER-Qv33r-Project-Purpose.md

- **Archival Function** -- The project's primary function is archival, not narrative. It does not tell a story; it captures a condition. See: QUEER-Qv33r-Project-Purpose.md

- **Camp as Encryption** -- Craft mechanism #5: style as cipher, defensive encoding. The most elaborate surface protecting the most vulnerable truth. See: QUEER-Queer-Aesthetic-of-Hiding.md

- **Claims Ledger** -- Research tool tracking core claims with supporting evidence, counterclaims, and resolution status. See: QUEER-QV33R-Research-Brief-Setup.md

- **Conservation Law** -- "No work may remain in a field where it no longer resists me." Resistance is a conserved quantity that cannot be optimized, automated, or faked. See: Temporal-Work-and-Struggle.md, QUEER-Temporal-Work-and-Struggle.md

- **Double-Channel Text** -- Central formal innovation: writing engineered to operate on two simultaneous frequencies (`$SURFACE_STORY` and `$SUBSTRATE_STORY`). The hiding is not a defect but an aesthetic of constrained transmission. See: QUEER-Queer-Aesthetic-of-Hiding.md

- **Encoding Schema** -- 7-variable portable schema for studying concealed queer desire across authors: `$SURFACE_STORY`, `$SUBSTRATE_STORY`, `$MASK_TYPE`, `$SIGNAL_TYPE`, `$SURVEILLANCE_PRESSURE`, `$PLAUSIBLE_DENIABILITY`, `$AFFECT_COST`. See: QUEER-Queer-Aesthetic-of-Hiding.md, QUEER-AI-prompts-for-QV33R.md

- **Four-Field Model** -- Governance model for lifetime creative labor, comprising Present Waking (Field I), Present Dreaming (Field II), Temporal Antagonism (Field III), and Binding/Translation (Field IV). See: Temporal-Work-and-Struggle.md, QUEER-Temporal-Work-and-Struggle.md

- **Irreversible Exposure** -- The activation condition for Field I. Text released without scaffolding, framing, or thesis defense. If it feels safe to post, it does not belong in Field I yet. See: QUEER-Qv33r-Project-Purpose.md, QUEER-Queer-Aesthetic-of-Hiding.md

- **Living Cultural Instrument** -- Core identity of the QV33R project. Not a story, a platform, or a brand, but a public, evolving queer archive of lived reality. See: QUEER-Qv33r-Project-Purpose.md

- **Mask Type** (`$MASK_TYPE`) -- Encoding variable for the type of concealment used (e.g., euphemism, allegory, genre deflection). See: QUEER-Queer-Aesthetic-of-Hiding.md, QUEER-AI-prompts-for-QV33R.md

- **Media Trajectory** -- Phased expansion model: text first, then visual/graphic work, then interviews/oral history, then podcast/reality-TV formats. See: QUEER-Qv33r-Project-Purpose.md

- **Negative Space as Content** -- Craft mechanism #2: ellipsis, hard cuts, redactions, skipped causality, interrupted scenes. The absence becomes the loudest data. See: QUEER-Queer-Aesthetic-of-Hiding.md

- **Overdetermined Innocent Details** -- Craft mechanism #3: atmospheric details (a look held too long, the timing of a departure) that are the substrate plot on the second channel. See: QUEER-Queer-Aesthetic-of-Hiding.md

- **Plausible Deniability** (`$PLAUSIBLE_DENIABILITY`) -- Encoding variable measuring the strength of the surface cover story. See: QUEER-Queer-Aesthetic-of-Hiding.md, QUEER-AI-prompts-for-QV33R.md

- **Pronoun Drift** -- Craft mechanism #1: referential blur and unstable reference. Names disappear; pronouns oscillate; the sentence refuses to pin the beloved down. See: QUEER-Queer-Aesthetic-of-Hiding.md

- **Public Creation** -- Building in public with audience participation. The archive only works if it is contemporaneous with its own conditions of production. See: QUEER-Qv33r-Project-Purpose.md, ChatGPT-Queer Project Growth Strategy.md, ChatGPT-QUEER Growth Strategy.md

- **Public Mask vs Private Voice** -- Craft mechanism #4: friction between social persona (performed in dialogue) and interiority (revealed through camera angle, stage direction, narration). See: QUEER-Queer-Aesthetic-of-Hiding.md

- **Resistance as Conserved Quantity** -- Foundational principle: resistance cannot be optimized, automated, or faked. Work must move when it no longer resists the maker. See: Temporal-Work-and-Struggle.md

- **Signal Type** (`$SIGNAL_TYPE`) -- Encoding variable for the type of recognition signal used (e.g., coded language, glance, tone). See: QUEER-Queer-Aesthetic-of-Hiding.md, QUEER-AI-prompts-for-QV33R.md

- **Substrate Story** (`$SUBSTRATE_STORY`) -- The hidden architecture of the double-channel text: what a queer-attuned reader detects as the real emotional plot beneath the surface. See: QUEER-Queer-Aesthetic-of-Hiding.md

- **Surface Story** (`$SURFACE_STORY`) -- The publicly legible layer of the double-channel text: atmospheric, literary, complete on its own terms. See: QUEER-Queer-Aesthetic-of-Hiding.md

- **Surveillance as Third Entity** -- Craft mechanism #6: the internalized watcher shapes the sentence. Self-correction, hedging, jokes that arrive too early, sudden moralizing that feels like cover. See: QUEER-Queer-Aesthetic-of-Hiding.md

- **Surveillance Pressure** (`$SURVEILLANCE_PRESSURE`) -- Encoding variable measuring the intensity of external monitoring on the writing subject. See: QUEER-Queer-Aesthetic-of-Hiding.md, QUEER-AI-prompts-for-QV33R.md

## Duplicate and Overlap Notes

1. **Temporal-Work-and-Struggle.md** and **QUEER-Temporal-Work-and-Struggle.md** are byte-identical (22,929 bytes each). The unprefixed version is the original shared source document; the QUEER-prefixed version is the project-local copy.

2. **ChatGPT-QUEER Growth Strategy.md** and **ChatGPT-Queer Project Growth Strategy.md** are distinct documents despite similar names. The first (1,226 words) covers public creation strategy for both QUEER and GRINDER. The second (2,426 words) is a detailed three-phase growth plan specific to QUEER.
